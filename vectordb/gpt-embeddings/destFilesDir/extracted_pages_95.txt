in Chart 3.10). Most indicators of new construction are consistent with a continued drag
from interest rates on this part of housing investment.
Higher interest rates have contributed to a reduction in housing transactions by reducing
housing demand. The reduction in housing transactions directly reduces total transfer
costs (orange bars in Chart 3.10), which make up around a fifth of total housing
investment. Mortgage approvals for house purchases, a key part of housing transactions,
have averaged below 50,000 per month in 2023. This is the lowest sustained level since
the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2008â€“09.
The connection between higher interest rates, lower housing transactions and investment
in existing dwellings is less clear. Prior to the pandemic, investment in existing dwellings
had a positive correlation with housing transactions. Part of that may reflect people
choosing to make investments in homes when they move. However, the relationship
between transactions and investment in existing dwellings has weakened since then,
potentially reflecting changes in household preferences after the pandemic. Investment in
existing dwellings (gold bars in Chart 3.10) is yet to fall.
Overall, housing investment has fallen by 6.4% in the year to 2023 Q2, reflecting the falls
in new dwellings investment and transfer costs. Housing investment is projected to fall by
a further 9.4% by the end of 2026.
