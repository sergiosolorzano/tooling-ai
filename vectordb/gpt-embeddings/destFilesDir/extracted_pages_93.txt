Interest rate rises will also reduce non-housing asset prices. Indeed, net financial wealth
relative to household incomes fell materially in 2022 despite no reduction in nominal
household deposits (Broadbent (2022) ). However, changes in household financial wealth
tend to have less overall impact on demand because most households do not own
significant non-housing and non-pension wealth. The effect can be important for those
households at the top of the wealth distribution where, prior to the pandemic, the richest
tenth of households had 17% of their total net wealth in financial assets. The consumption
effect of reductions in the value of financial wealth are captured within the purple bars in
Chart 3.7.
Although not directly affected by rising interest rates, households in the rental sector may
also face increased housing costs, leading to further reductions in consumer demand.
Specifically, rising interest rates increase costs for buy-to-let (BTL) landlords with a
mortgage and reduce their returns through lower house prices. Landlords may try to pass
on their costs through rent increases. In the long term, rent rises will be driven byChart 3.9: Some measures of nominal house prices have fallen somewhat in recent

estimated to be smaller.
Renters are also affected by the impact of interest rates on the housing sector .
