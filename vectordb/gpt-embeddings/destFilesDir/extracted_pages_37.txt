Although aggregate global growth has evolved largely as expected, growth in major
economies has been diverging. In particular, US GDP growth has been stronger, while the
euro area has seen weaker GDP growth. Chinese GDP grew more rapidly than expected
in Q3, but has been weaker than before the Covid pandemic for the last few years.
US GDP rose by 1.2% according to the advance estimate for 2023 Q3, faster than
projected in the August Report. US growth has been around its pre-pandemic average in
recent quarters despite the sharp tightening in monetary policy. Household consumption
has grown more quickly than household incomes over 2022–23. This suggests that US
households in aggregate have been more willing to run down the significant increase in
savings accrued during the Covid pandemic (de Soyres et al (2023)  provide an
international comparison). The US has also been less exposed to global energy price
shocks than Europe, as it is not reliant on gas supplies from Russia. When wholesale gas
prices peaked in August 2022, European prices were over 10 times higher than in North
America (Broadbent (2023) ).
In the euro area, quarterly GDP fell by 0.1% in the 2023 Q3 preliminary flash estimate,
following weak growth of around 0.1% in both Q1 and Q2. Tighter monetary policy has
reduced growth, and retail energy prices remain high, despite having fallen since late
2022, which has weighed on real incomes and spending. Euro-area households have also
tended to maintain savings built up over the pandemic period, rather than spending them.
Recent analysis  by staff at the ECB (Battistini et al (2023) ) shows that most of the
increase in household savings has been invested in financial assets such as equities and
bonds, rather than in more liquid deposits. This suggests that household savings are less
likely to be run down in the near term.
In China, GDP grew by 1.3% in 2023 Q3, up from 0.5% in Q2. Even including 2023 Q3,
Chinese GDP growth has slowed since the Covid pandemic. Quarterly GDP growth has
averaged around 1% since 2021, whereas 1.5% or more was typical before the pandemic.
Other indicators of activity such as PMIs and retail sales have softened on the quarter .
Activity in the property sector, which plays a significant role in China’s economy, continued
to be weak, with property starts falling by more than 15% over the 12 months to
September. While only around 5% of UK exports go to China, its key role in global trade
means that the indirect effect, via mutual trading partners, of changes in Chinese demand
on the UK can be more significant. And there are other channels, for example via financial
markets, through which developments in China can affect the UK (Gilhooly et al (2018)).…with notable regional differences.
