In the GDP projection conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates
at 5.25% over the forecast period, growth is lower in the forecast period compared with
the MPC’s projection conditioned on market rates, as the constant rate assumption is
above the market curve to an increasing degree beyond the end of next year .
Within the expenditure components underpinning the November GDP projection
conditioned on market interest rates, calendar-year household spending is expected to
grow by ½% this year, to be flat in 2024, and to rise by ½% in 2025 and by 1% in 2026
(Table 1.D). This projected path of consumption is weaker than in the August Report. Real
post-tax labour income is projected to grow by ¾% this year and by 1% in 2024, but more
modestly in 2025 and 2026. Taking account of all components of household income, theChart 1.1: GDP growth projection based on market interest rate expectations, other
policy measures as announced
The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for GDP  growth. It has been conditioned on Bank Rate
following a path implied by market yields, but allows the Committee’ s judgement on the risks around the other
conditioning assumptions set out in Section 1.1, including wholesale energy prices, to af fect the calibration of the fan
chart skew. To the left of the shaded area, the distribution reflects uncertainty around revisions to the data over the past.
To the right of the shaded area, the distribution reflects uncertainty over the evolution of GDP growth in the future. If
economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective judgement is
that the mature estimate of GDP growth would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those occasions. The fan
chart is constructed so that outturns are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter aqua areas on 30 occasions.
In any particular quarter of the forecast period, GDP growth is therefore expected to lie somewhere within the fan on 90
out of 100 occasions. And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions GDP growth can fall anywhere outside the aqua
area of the fan chart. Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the grey background. See the Box on page 39
of the November 2007 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and what it represents.
