(Chart 2.9). Other similarly forward-looking business activity indicators, such as the latest
Lloyds Business Barometer and the British Chambers of Commerce’s Quarterly
Economics Survey, have also remained consistent with positive GDP growth.
Combining the steers from a range of business surveys, among which the near-term
output balances get the greatest weight, Bank staff expect GDP growth of 0.1% in 2023
Q4. The projection for broadly flat output over the second half of 2023 is weaker than the
August projection of around ¼% growth per quarter. The anticipated softening in growth
chimes with the weakening observed across several other near-term indicators, such as
those for employment growth, the housing market and global activity (Section 2.1).
Timely measures of labour demand have softened against a backdrop of subdued activity.
Vacancies edged down further from their 2022 peaks in the three months to September.
The S&P Global/CIPS UK composite employment PMI has also been in contractionary
territory for a couple of months (Chart 2.10). The permanent staff placements index from
the KPMG/REC UK Report on Jobs was below its historical average in September .
Official estimates of employment growth have also weakened. The most recent ONS
Workforce Jobs and HMRC payrolls data point to a modest but positive quarterly growth in
employment in Q3, and a small contraction in employment growth in Q4. There have been
notable uncertainties surrounding recent Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates. These
have made the data harder to interpret and have resulted in the ONS temporarily pausing
its publication of LFS estimates following the June data (Box B). Alternative experimental
statistics published by the ONS, which take the LFS employment estimate in the three
months to June and project it forward in line with the HMRC payrolls data thereafter ,
suggest that employment fell by 0.2% in the three months to August. As experimental
statistics, these estimates need to be interpreted with caution.Overall, Bank staff project a 0.1% increase in GDP in Q4. The 2023 H2 projection is
weaker than expected in the August Report.
The softening in activity is affecting labour demand.
