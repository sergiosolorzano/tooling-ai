Monetary Policy Summary
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet
the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its
meeting ending on 1 November 2023, the MPC voted by a majority of 6–3 to maintain
Bank Rate at 5.25%. Three members preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage
points, to 5.5%.
The Committee’s updated projections for activity and inflation are set out in the
accompanying November Monetary Policy Report. These are conditioned on a market-
implied path for Bank Rate that remains around 5¼% until 2024 Q3 and then declines
gradually to 4¼% by the end of 2026, a lower profile than underpinned the August
projections.
Since the MPC’s previous meeting, long-term government bond yields have increased
across advanced economies. GDP growth has been stronger than expected in the United
States. Underlying inflationary pressures in advanced economies remain elevated.
Following events in the Middle East, the oil futures curve has risen somewhat while gas
futures prices are little changed.
UK GDP is expected to have been flat in 2023 Q3, weaker than projected in the August
Report. Some business surveys are pointing to a slight contraction of output in Q4 but
others are less pessimistic. GDP is expected to grow by 0.1% in Q4, also weaker than
projected previously.
The MPC continues to consider a wide range of data to inform its view on developments
in labour market activity, rather than focusing on a single indicator. The increasing
uncertainties surrounding the Labour Force Survey underline the importance of this
approach. Against a backdrop of subdued economic activity, employment growth is likely
to have softened over the second half of 2023, and to a greater extent than projected in
the August Report. Falling vacancies and surveys indicating an easing of recruitment
difficulties also point to a loosening in the labour market. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents
have similarly reported an easing in hiring constraints, although persistent skills shortages
remain in some sectors.
Pay growth has remained high across a range of indicators, although the recent rise in the
annual rate of growth of private sector regular average weekly earnings has not been
apparent in other series. There remains uncertainty about the near-term path of pay, but
