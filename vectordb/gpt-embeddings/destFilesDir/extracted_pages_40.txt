Over the past two years, central banks in the UK, US and euro area have tightened policy
(Chart 2.5). Since August, the ECB Governing Council raised its key policy rates by 25
basis points in September and held rates on 26 October, leaving the deposit facility rate at
4%. In the US, the FOMC has kept the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged
at 5.25%â€“5.5%.
In both the US and euro area, market-implied paths for policy rates are consistent with no
further increases in this tightening cycle. Since the August Report, the market-implied path
for policy rates in the euro area is little changed, while the path for US rates is, on
average, around 50 basis points higher (Chart 2.5).
Since the August Report, market expectations of UK policy rates have fallen by about 60
basis points over the next three years, on average (Chart 2.5). The market curve has also
flattened. The UK curve remains broadly above the US and euro area, although the gap
has narrowed.Market expectations suggest policy rates are at or near their peaks.
