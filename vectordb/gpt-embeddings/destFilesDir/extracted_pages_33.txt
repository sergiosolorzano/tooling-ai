to 7.4% in July but declined to 6.8% in August, 0.3 percentage points lower than
expected in the August Report. Some of those movements were linked to services
such as airfares and accommodation that tend to be volatile over the summer
holiday period. Excluding these travel-related components, services inflation had
been more stable at continued high rates, albeit slightly weaker than expected.
CPI inflation was expected to fall significantly further in the near term, reflecting
lower annual energy inflation, despite the renewed upward pressure from oil prices,
and further declines in food and core goods price inflation. Services price inflation,
however, was projected to remain elevated in the near term, with some potential
month-to-month volatility.
Developments in key indicators of inflation persistence had been mixed, with the
acceleration in the AWE not apparent in other measures of wages and with some
downside news on services inflation. There were increasing signs of some impact of
tighter monetary policy on the labour market and on momentum in the real
economy more generally. Given the significant increase in Bank Rate since the start
of this tightening cycle, the current monetary policy stance was restrictive.
The MPC would continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary
pressures and resilience in the economy as a whole, including the tightness of
labour market conditions and the behaviour of wage growth and services price
inflation. Monetary policy would need to be sufficiently restrictive for sufficiently long
to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with the
Committeeâ€™s remit. Further tightening in monetary policy would have been required
if there were evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures.
