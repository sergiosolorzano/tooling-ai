There has been a marked fall in wholesale gas prices since 2022 (Chart 2.4), now feeding

in measures of consumer confidence, which have shown a marked rebound from near-
historic lows in 2022, aligns closely with the fall in wholesale gas prices, probably
reflecting households expecting lower energy bills in the future. In the most recent data,

above its low point in 2022.Chart 3.2: A resilient labour market and a fall in energy prices have supported an
improvement in household real income growth

Sources: ONS and Bank calculations.
(a) Contributions to real labour income growth are approximations calculated as the growth rate of the individual series
and so do not exactly sum to the total. Prices are measured using the three-month average seasonally adjusted CPI
index. Wages are defined as seasonally adjusted whole economy total average weekly earnings. The recent
contributions from employment growth may be affected by additional uncertainties around interpreting official estimates
of labour market activity (see Box B for more detail). The final data points refer to July 2023.
Real incomes have been supported by the fall in energy prices.
Incomes have also been supported by the Government’s measures to help
households weather the pandemic and energy price shock. These are now being
