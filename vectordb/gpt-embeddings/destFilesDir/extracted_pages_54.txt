near-term inflation expectations, appear to have played a role in supporting wage growth
since 2021 (Chart 2.14). As headline inflation and near-term inflation expectations have
started to fall, they are likely to exert less upward pressure on pay growth in 2024.
A number of forward-looking indicators suggest that nominal wage growth is likely to
moderate in 2023 Q4 and in 2024. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents expect settlements to
fall to around 4% to 5% next year, and for there to be fewer additional payments provided
to compensate for a higher cost of living. Respondents to the DMP  Survey expect wage
growth of 5.1% next year.Chart 2.14: Easing labour market tightness and falling inflation expectations
should reduce pay growth in the near term
Contributions to annual private sector regular pay growth (a)
Sources: ONS and Bank calculations.
(a)  Wage equation based on Yellen (2017) . Private sector regular pay growth is Bank staff’s estimate of underlying pay
growth between January 2020 and March 2022 and ONS private sector regular pay growth otherwise. Short-term
inflation expectations are based on the Barclays Basix Index and the YouGov/Citigroup one year ahead measure of
household inflation expectations and projected forward based on a Bayesian V AR estimation. Slack is based on the
MPC’s estimate of the vacancies to unemployment ratio. Productivity growth is based on long-run market sector
productivity growth per head. The unexplained component is the residual. Data are to 2023 Q2, projections are for 2023
Q3 to 2024 Q1.
…and forward-looking indicators suggest that wage growth will fall back.
