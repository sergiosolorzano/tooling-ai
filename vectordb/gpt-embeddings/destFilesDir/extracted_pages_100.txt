Annex: Other forecasters ’ expectations
This annex reports the results of the Bank’s most recent survey of external forecasters.
Responses were submitted in the two weeks to 20 October and are summarised in Chart
A. These are compared with the MPC’s modal projections, which are conditioned on a
range of assumptions (Section 1.1) that may differ from those made by external
forecasters.
On average, respondents expected GDP to rise by 0.6% in the four quarters to 2024 Q4
(left panel, Chart A). Responses ranged from -0.5% to 2.2%. Four-quarter GDP growth
was then expected to rise, on average, to 1.4% in 2025 Q4 and remain at 1.4% in 2026
Q4. These forecasts are higher than the MPC’s modal projections for 2025 Q4 and 2026
Q4 of 0.4% and 1.1% respectively.
External forecasters expected an unemployment rate of 4.8% in 2024 Q4, higher than the
MPC’s projection of 4.7% (middle panel, Chart A). The average external forecast then falls
to 4.6% for 2025 Q4 and 2026 Q4. By comparison, in the MPC’s projection, the
unemployment rate increases to 5.0% in 2025 Q4 rising to 5.1% in 2026 Q4.
CPI inflation was expected to fall on average, to 2.4% in 2024 Q4, a slightly faster decline
than the MPC’s projection of 3.1% (right panel, Chart A). The average forecasts for 2025
Q4 and 2026 Q4 were broadly in line with the 2% target at 2.1% for both periods, a little
above the MPC’s modal projections at 1.9% and 1.5%.
