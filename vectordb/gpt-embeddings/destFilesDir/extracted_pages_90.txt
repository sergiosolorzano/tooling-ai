four fifths of mortgages are on fixed rates. This means changes in interest rates do not
immediately affect payments on the majority of mortgages, but rather only when those
mortgages are refinanced.
Despite this, the reduction in consumption from rising mortgage costs is expected to
outweigh the boost to consumption from higher savings income. In general, changes in
income do not affect consumption one-for-one. Instead, they depend on households’
marginal propensity to consume. This measures the responsiveness of consumption to a
given change in income. Estimates of marginal propensities to consume vary significantly
over a number of different dimensions. Analysis suggests that a household’s marginal
propensity to consume will be lower, meaning consumption changes less in response to a
given income change, if the income change is positive, the household has a high income
and if the household is not liquidity constrained (see, for example, Christelis et al (2017)
and Albuquerque and Green (2022)). Households with positive net savings are more
likely to meet all of these conditions compared to households with large loans. This means
that households with large savings are likely to increase consumption relatively little in
response to rising savings incomes, but those with mortgages and other loans will reduce
consumption materially in response to higher loan costs. The net result is for demand to
fall despite the net aggregate increase in household income.
The NMG survey also suggests that the overall direct effects of interest rates on
household cash flows will reduce consumption. As Chart 3.8 shows, mortgagor
households are far more likely to report a negative effect on household finances from
interest rates than the equivalent share of saver households who report a positive impact
from higher interest rates.
The consumption effects from higher mortgage payments are expected to build over time
(aqua bars in Chart 3.7). This reflects the large number of people on fixed-rate mortgages
who have yet to experience an increase in mortgage costs (Box B in the May 2023
Report). However, the aggregate reduction in consumption is likely to materialise
somewhat faster than the realised increase in mortgage costs. This is because it is likely
that those with fixed-rate mortgages coming to an end will know that their mortgage costs
are going to increase and adjust consumption in advance. The Bank’s NMG survey shows
that just over 30% of mortgagors who are yet to reach the end of their fixed-rate loan have
already spent less as a result. And only around two fifths of these mortgagors expect to
take no action in the next year as a result of the future increase in mortgage costs.
