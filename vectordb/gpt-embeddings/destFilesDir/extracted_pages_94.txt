household income and housing supply growth. However, given information asymmetries,
moving costs, and other frictions within the rental market, landlords may temporarily have
market power to raise rents. Landlords may also choose to sell their property , and there is
some evidence that recent market exit by landlords has caused a degree of shrinkage of
the private rented sector. Evidence from the Bank’s Agents suggests some smaller BTL
investors have left the market due to regulatory changes (the scale of selling in the BTL
sector is discussed in Bank of England (2023)).
Together, these effects appear to be contributing to rapid increases in rents. The CPI
measure of rents rose by 6.4% over the year to 2023 Q3 – the fastest pace since 1994.
This measure is also a lagging indicator of the potential impact of interest rate rises on
rents as it measures rent increases across all rental properties rather than the increases
faced by those moving home. Estimates from Rightmove suggest that average new rents
rose by 10% over the year to 2023 Q3. Most of this rapid increase in rents will reflect high
nominal income growth during the period of high inflation. But higher rents from other
factors may cause households to cut back on other forms of consumption, reducing
demand in the wider economy. More broadly, renter households who are net borrowers
report similar impacts of higher interest rates on their finances as mortgagor households
(Chart 3.8).
Housing investment
Housing investment is likely to be reduced by higher interest rates. This form of
investment makes up only around 5% of overall GDP but is one of the most variable
components, meaning that it can have an outsized effect on aggregate growth over the
business cycle. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, falls in housing investment
accounted for close to a quarter of the overall fall in GDP. This means that the impact of
interest rates on housing investment is particularly important for the transmission of
monetary policy.
As shown in Chart 3.10, the ONS splits housing investment into three main categories:
investment in new dwellings; improvements, repair and maintenance of existing dwellings;
and transfer costs, which include many of the costs of moving home such as legal fees.
Each of these can be affected by interest rates.
Higher interest rates will result in a lower real return on building new homes because it will
reduce the expected future selling price. It will therefore encourage housing developers to
reduce investment, and indeed this is what has happened over the past year (green barsThe impacts of interest rates on the housing market also reduce housing
investment, for example by reducing the number of housing transactions.
