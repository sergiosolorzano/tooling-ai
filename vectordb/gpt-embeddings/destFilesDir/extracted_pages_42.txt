Interest rates on bank loans to UK businesses have been rising, reflecting the increase in
Bank Rate. In the latest data for August, the interest rate on new bank loans stood at
nearly 7%, compared to around 2% at the start of the tightening cycle.
Larger companies are able to borrow from capital markets, for example by issuing bonds.
While spreads over risk-free rates on both high-yield and investment-grade corporate
bonds have narrowed by around 90 basis points since late last year , higher risk-free rates
have increased the overall cost of issuing bonds.
The availability of mortgage credit declined in 2023 Q3, continuing the trend of the last
two years, according to the latest Credit Conditions Survey (CCS). Tighter wholesale
funding conditions and expectations for house prices were the most significant factors
reported to be reducing credit availability. The availability of unsecured credit fell slightly
on the quarter, although lenders expected little change over the next three months.Chart 2.6: Rises in reference rates have fed through to mortgage rates, and

saving products represent averages of daily quoted rates using data to 24 October and were provisional. OIS rate and
