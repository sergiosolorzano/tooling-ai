Inflation is expected to fall to 4.8% in October and remain around that level for the rest of
the year. The main driver of the expected fall in Q4 is a reduction in the Ofgem energy
price cap, reflecting the decline in wholesale gas prices over the course of 2023. The
typical household energy bill is going down to £1,834 annually at that point. Because the
typical bill rose to £2,500 over the same period a year ago, the lower level of the cap this
year will have a material impact on the annual inflation rate in 2023 Q4. Based on
wholesale gas prices up to 24 October 2023, the energy price cap is projected to rise
again by around £130 in 2024 Q1. This would remain well below the typical bill in the
same quarter this year, so energy prices would continue to contribute negatively to the
annual inflation rate.
Sterling oil prices have risen by 10% since the August Report (Section 2.1). Higher
sterling oil prices feed through to petrol prices relatively quickly . Fuel prices are still
expected to contribute negatively to CPI inflation in 2023 Q4, but that contribution is
smaller than in the August forecast.Chart 2.16: Consumer price inflation has fallen since last year’s peak and is

Inflation is expected to fall markedly in October to 4.8%, largely reflecting a
reduction in the Ofgem price cap.
