Four-quarter UK-weighted world export price inflation, excluding the direct ef fect of oil
prices, is estimated to have been slightly negative in 2023 Q2 and is expected to decline
more sharply over the next year, though by slightly less than anticipated in the August
Report. The weak absolute profile continues to reflect the clearing of global supply chain
bottlenecks and easing producer price pressures, particularly in China. W orld export price
inflation then turns slightly positive from the middle of 2025, broadly unchanged from the
August Report. The recent depreciation of the sterling exchange rate (Section 1.1) will put
upward pressure on UK import price inflation, and over time on CPI inflation, relative to
the August Report. Overall, import prices are projected to fall by 1¾% in 2023, a lesser fall
than expected in the August Report, and by 3% in 2024 (Table 1.D).
The MPC is continuing to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures
and resilience in the economy as a whole (Key judgement 1), including a range of
measures of the underlying tightness of labour market conditions (Key judgement 2),
wage growth and services price inflation.
Services CPI inflation has remained elevated and somewhat stronger than can be
explained by a simple empirical model based on developments in labour and non-labour
input costs. There has, however, been some signs of a turning point in a measure of
underlying inflationary pressures in consumer services prices (Chart 2.18).
Annual private sector regular average weekly earnings (AWE) growth has increased
further to 8.0% in the three months to August, materially above expectations in the August
Report. This most recent rise in growth is difficult to reconcile with other indicators of pay
growth (Section 2.3). Most of these have tended to be more stable at rates of growth that
are high but not quite as elevated as the AWE series. For example, a Bank staff proxy for
the private sector based on HMRC PAYE Real Time Information shows median pay
growth of around 7% currently.
Recent outturns in earnings growth have been stronger than standard models of wage
growth, based on productivity, short-term inflation expectations and a measure of
economic slack, would have predicted (Chart 1.3). The near-term outlook for pay growth is
also expected to be somewhat stronger than projected in the August Report. The annual
growth rate of private sector regular AWE is nonetheless still projected to decline in
coming quarters, to below 6% next spring and to just below 5% by the end of 2024. This is
broadly consistent with the forward-looking indications from the Decision Maker Panel and
early evidence from the Bank’s Agents on private sector pay settlements next year.
