Accumulating evidence of loosening labour market conditions and the signals from
leading indicators of pay growth underpin the central projection for wage growth, which
falls slightly to 7¼% in Q4, before declining more substantially to around 5% by the end of
2024, predicated on the expected path for inflation. The recent pattern of upside surprises
in the official wage data may point to some upside risk to this projection, whereas the REC
survey continues to suggest risks to the downside.
Twelve-month consumer price inflation fell to 6.8% in July before edging down further to
6.7% in August and remaining at 6.7% in September (Chart 2.16). This was 0.3
percentage points below the August Report forecast. Declines in inflation up to July had
been driven largely by lower energy prices. But in August, core CPI inflation, which
excludes energy, food, beverages and tobacco, fell to 6.2% and further to 6.1% in
September, having been relatively stable at just under 7% in preceding months. The
decline in core inflation was driven by core goods inflation, which stood at 4.7% in
September, 1 percentage point below the August forecast.Overall, annual private sector regular pay growth is projected to fall to around
7¼% in Q4 before declining quite markedly in 2024, but the outlook remains highly
uncertain.
Consumer price inflation is falling, but remains well above the 2% inflation target.
