emerge. Reflecting the higher expected path of wage growth, the Committee has decided
in this forecast to increase slightly the scale of its judgement on the persistence of
domestic prices in its modal projection, crystallising further some of the upside risks from
second-round effects that have been incorporated into the mean projection previously.
This is in addition to the Committee’s decision in this forecast to increase the medium-
term equilibrium rate of unemployment (Key judgement 2), which has a similar ef fect on
increasing the persistence of wage growth and domestic inflationary pressures.
In the MPC’s modal projection conditioned on the market-implied path of interest rates as
captured in the 15-working day average to 24 October, CPI inflation declines to below the
2% target from the end of 2025, as an increasing degree of slack in the economy reduces
domestic inflationary pressures alongside declining external cost pressures. CPI inflation
is projected to be 1.9% in two years’ time and 1.5% in three years (Table 1.C and Chart
1.4). Compared with the August Report modal projection, CPI inflation is expected to
return to close to the 2% target slightly less rapidly in the middle of the forecast period,
reflecting higher energy and other import price inflation, with the latest profile relatively flat
around 2% over the four quarters from 2025 Q2.
