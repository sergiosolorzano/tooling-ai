The increase in the equilibrium rate of unemployment also pushes down aggregate supply
growth. Four-quarter supply growth is expected to slow from around 1½% currently to
around ¾% next year, before rising to around 1¼% in the medium term, the latter of which
is similar to in previous Reports. The Committee will undertake a full review of the
determinants of the overall longer-term supply capacity of the economy in its next regular
stocktake ahead of the February 2024 Report.
Although aggregate supply is expected to be relatively subdued, particularly in the near
term, the outlook for demand is weaker, leading to an increasing degree of economic
slack emerging in the Committee’s latest projections from the start of next year. The
margin of aggregate excess supply is expected to widen to just over 1½% of potential
GDP by the end of the forecast period (Table 1.A), broadly similar to its path in the August
Report. Relative to August, the projection for excess demand/supply has been pushed up
by the lower market path of interest rates and by the Committee’ s judgement to raise the
equilibrium rate of unemployment, which has reduced potential supply . But the projection
has been pushed down by the Committee’s decision to scale back slightly the extent of its
judgement boosting expected demand.
In part reflecting indications of relatively optimistic longer-term expectations for output,
companies are expected to continue to respond to the weakness in demand by retaining
their existing inputs, while using them less intensively and hoarding labour for a prolonged
period. This limits to some extent the rise in unemployment that would otherwise be
expected to occur. Nevertheless, in the MPC’s November projection, the unemployment
rate is projected to continue to rise gradually over the forecast period such that it exceeds
the Committee’s updated estimate of the medium-term equilibrium rate from the end of
next year, and it reaches just over 5% by the end of 2026 (Chart 1.2). This is slightly
higher than in the August Report, but is consistent with a similar degree of labour market
looseness, reflecting the Committee’s judgement to raise further the equilibrium rate in
this forecast.
