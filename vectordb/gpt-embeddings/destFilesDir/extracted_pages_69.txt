These indicative estimates only give a snapshot of the possible impact of the
reweighting in mid-2022 on the participation, employment and unemployment rates.
In addition to the uncertainty over these impacts, it is possible that any future
revised estimates will also reveal a change to the recent path of these labour
market variables.
While there are increased uncertainties about the LFS data, the Committee’ s views
on labour market developments are informed by a wide range of data. The MPC
looks at other official data, such as the ONS Workforce Jobs and HMRC payrolls
data, and wider labour market indicators, such as private sector surveys and
intelligence from the Bank’s Agents. In addition to the vacancies to unemployment
ratio, surveys of recruitment difficulties inform the MPC’s assessment of labour
market tightness. The collective steer from these data sources is discussed in
Sections 2.2 and 2.3.These increased uncertainties in the official LFS data reaffirm the
importance of taking a steer from a wide range of data on labour market
developments.
