Wage settlements were expected to trend down slightly over the rest of this year.
Early indications for 2024 suggested that average pay increases were expected to
be lower than in 2023. But those businesses that rely heavily on lower-paid workers
were concerned about another sizable increase in the National Living W age next
April.
Contacts reported price falls for a range of key inputs, despite increases in the oil
price and the recent depreciation of the pound. Manufacturersâ€™ domestic price
inflation has continued to ease, with an increasing number of contacts expecting to
return to a single small annual price increase in 2024 and some hoping to avoid
price increases all together.
Business services price inflation has remained high, but contacts judged that it had
peaked amid more caution about price rises, even in sectors such as law ,
accountancy, and IT where demand had been strong.
Aggregate profit margins have remained squeezed as many companies were
unable to fully pass through higher costs into output prices while sales volumes
were weakening. Firms saw limited scope for margin rebuilding through further
price increases, with many instead focused on operational efficiency improvements.
Consumer goods price inflation has continued to ease for a broad range of
categories. Food producers reported ingredient costs either stabilising or falling.
Price inflation for new cars has passed its peak and was expected to moderate
further. Contacts expected little change in prices for electronics, white goods, and
furniture. Clothing retailers reported low single-digit inflation for their autumn and
winter ranges.
Inflationary pressures for consumer services were weakening more slowly than for
goods. But restaurants, pubs and hotels saw somewhat limited scope for further
price increases without adverse consequences for sales volumes. Health services
inflation appeared likely to remain high, with continuing cost pressures and robust
demand.Goods inflation is slowing more quickly than for services inflation as input
cost pressures continue to ease.
