The ONS plans to incorporate updated population estimates in December , and this
is expected to result in revisions to the LFS back data.
Bank staff estimates of the impact of using more up to date population weights are
shown in Chart B. Those estimates suggest that the population reweighting would
reduce the employment and participation rates in mid-2022 by around 0.4
percentage points. These estimates use the latest publicly available population
estimates from January 2023, but the ONS plans to publish a further update later
this month.
The indicative staff estimates point to a limited impact on the unemployment rate in
mid-2022 from the population reweighting. As vacancies are measured through a
different survey, this also implies little impact on the vacancies to unemployment
ratio – one of the MPC’s key measures of labour market tightness.Bank staff estimates using more up to date population weights point to
notable downward revisions to the employment and participation rates in
mid-2022, but a smaller effect on the unemployment rate.

expected to reduce estimates of the participation and employment rates in
mid-2022

change between 2019 Q4 and the three months to July 2022 in the current LFS estimates versus the indicative
post-revision estimates calculated by Bank staff.
