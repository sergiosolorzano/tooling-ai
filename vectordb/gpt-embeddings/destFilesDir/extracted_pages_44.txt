growth has been driven by a reduction in net lending by banks, particularly in net lending
to other financial institutions, as well as sales from the Bank’ s asset purchase facility,
which tend to reduce the level of bank deposits.
2.2: Domestic activity and the labour market
Latest estimates suggest GDP increased by 0.2% in 2023 Q2, down a little from 0.3%
growth in Q1 but marginally stronger than expected in the August Report. Household
consumption and business investment boosted headline GDP, while housing investment
dragged on growth (Chart 2.8). Although Q2 GDP grew only slightly on the previous
quarter, the latest annual ONS Blue Book revisions shifted up the level of GDP by around
2% (Box C).Chart 2.7: Aggregate money and lending growth have slowed
Twelve-month growth rate of aggregate money and lending (a)
(a) Aggregate money, excluding other financial corporations refers to M4 excluding other financial corporations (OFCs).
Aggregate money and aggregate lending refer to M4 and M4 lending respectively , both excluding intermediate other
financial corporations (IOFCs). OFCs are corporations engaged in financial services that are not banks nor building
societies, for example insurance companies and pension funds. IOFCs are specialised entities that mainly provide
intermediation services to banks and building societies. Only quarterly data are available for the aggregate money and
aggregate lending series from 1998 Q4 to 2010 Q2. All other data are at a monthly frequency. The final data points refer
to September 2023. For more information on these data, see Further details about M4 data, Further details about
M4 excluding intermediate other financial corporations (OFCs) data  and Further details about M4 lending
excluding lending to intermediate other financial corporations data .
UK GDP growth averaged around ¼% per quarter over 2023 H1.
