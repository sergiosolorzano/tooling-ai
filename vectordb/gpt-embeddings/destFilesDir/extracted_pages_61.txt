Both domestic workers and firms have suffered real income losses following the
deterioration in the UK’s terms of trade, which has been driven largely by the increase in
imported energy costs (Martin and Reynolds (2023)). Chart 3.2 shows the squeeze on
real labour incomes. Meanwhile, the Bank’s DMP Survey suggests that firms’ margins
have been more likely to fall than rise over the past year. These results are in line with
recent work by Piton et al (2023): UK firms’ earnings in excess of all production costs
have been declining since the start of 2022, as they did following sharp rises in energy
prices in the past. However, the decline in profits has not been uniform across firms. While
many firms have experienced declining profits, some firms with greater market power
have been able to increase their margins.
Against the backdrop of past reductions in aggregate margins, there is some evidence to
suggest that firms may attempt to rebuild margins as external cost pressures moderate. In
the DMP Survey, more firms expect their profit margins to increase than to decrease in the
coming year. But the Bank’s Agents report that firms currently see limited scope for margin
rebuilding through further price increases (Box D). The extent to which firms are able to
improve their margins is likely to depend on the outlook for demand (Section 3).
If firms and employees seek to recoup lost incomes by pushing for higher prices and
wages, the second-round effects from the increase in global energy and goods prices may
take longer to unwind. These risks continue to underpin the upside risks to the MPC’s
inflation projection (Key judgement 3 in Section 1).2.4: Inﬂation expectations
In the latest YouGov/Citigroup survey, short-term household inflation expectations
remained broadly unchanged at still elevated levels, after falling back significantly from
their peaks in 2022 (Chart 2.19). Medium-term inflation expectations in this survey stand
close to their 2010–19 average. The distribution of inflation expectations within surveys
may contain information. The share of respondents expecting annual inflation of 6% or
more on average over the medium term remained broadly stable at around 16% between
August and October, well below the peak of 31% in August 2022 and close to the average
level over 2019.In aggregate, firms’ margins appear to have been squeezed in the past couple of
years. There is some evidence to suggest that firms plan to rebuild margins.
Household inflation expectations have continued to ease.
