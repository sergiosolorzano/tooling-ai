The largest component of lower demand from higher interest rates is estimated to come
from household consumption, in part because consumption makes up around 60% of total
GDP. The effects of higher rates on housing investment, business investment and the
exchange rate are all also important for the overall impact on demand. The following
sections present evidence of the impact that rate rises are having on the economy
through each of these channels so far.
Overall, the impact of higher interest rates on GDP is expected to materialise with a
significant lag: in the November projections, it takes until 2025 for the GDP  impact to be
close to fully felt. Based on the average relationships over the past between Bank Rate,
other financial instruments and economic activity, Bank staff estimate that more than half
of the impact on the level of GDP is still to come through, although there is significant
uncertainty around that estimate. The impact is likely to be felt more quickly on housing
investment and more slowly on consumption.
There are a wide range of factors, some of which change over time, that are likely to af fect
the impact that interest rates have on the economy. For example, as set out in Mann
(2023) , financial market conditions, the level of interest rates prior to initial rate rises, and
the evolution of real rates have the potential to affect the pass-through of rate rises to the
economy. The structure of the economy may itself also affect monetary policy
transmission, such as the value and distribution of assets and loans.

Chart 3.7 presents an estimate of the impact of higher interest rates since August 2021 on
the level of household consumption, both so far and into the future. The total effect is split
into broad categories that show the relative size of some of the channels of monetary
policy transmission. The mortgage cash-flow channel captures the direct impact of
changes in household mortgage costs. The broader housing channel represents the
impact of changes in the value of housing. This includes, among other effects, changes in
the available collateral against which households can borrow and ef fects on households’
saving behaviour. Other channels are captured in the purple bars. This includes a range
of mechanisms such as the impact of interest rates on financial wealth, and ‘second-
round’ effects in which a reduction in demand then leads to households cutting
consumption as the wider economy weakens.Higher interest rates reduce household consumption through a range of channels.
