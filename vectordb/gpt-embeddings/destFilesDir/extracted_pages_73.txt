Higher finance costs and greater economic uncertainty have led some contacts –
especially those already facing margin or cash-flow pressure, or those dependent
on borrowing to invest – to lower their investment intentions. Those with strong cash
positions plan to continue to invest: business services firms continue to spend on
information and other technology; professional service firms are most likely to refer
to meaningful investment in AI technologies aimed at creating efficiencies rather
than reducing headcount; consumer services are investing to maintain their service
offering; while many production firms are focusing on green energy generation and
other efficiency measures.
These considerations continue to shape investment intentions. Chart A summarises
responses to a recent Agents’ special survey on this topic. The main factors
supporting investment intentions are digitalisation, efficiency, and sustainability,
while the cost of external finance is the largest reported drag.Investment growth is expected to slow slightly but remain positive next
year, driven by the need to maintain and upgrade information and other
technology, the pursuit of efficiencies and investment to improve
sustainability.
