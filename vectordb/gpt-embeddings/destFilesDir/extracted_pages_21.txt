In the MPC’s modal projection, private sector regular AWE growth falls to around 3% by
the end of the forecast period, as short-term inflation expectations are assumed to fall
back and a margin of spare capacity is expected to open up in the labour market in the
medium term (Key judgement 2). This is a slightly higher medium-term profile for AWE
growth compared with the August Report.
Private sector regular AWE growth is also expected to ease more slowly than the range of
forecasts from a suite of wage models would predict (Chart 1.3). These empirical models
illustrate what could happen if future pay setting is based on inflation expectations that
take account of the sharply downward near-term path of CPI inflation among other factors.
But there is insufficient evidence at present to be confident that wages will be set in this
way.
This difference between empirical model outputs and the November projection is therefore
one way of demonstrating the MPC’s continuing judgement that second-round effects in
both domestic prices and wages are expected to take longer to unwind than they did toChart 1.3: Projections for private sector regular average weekly earnings four-

The shaded swathe represents a range of projections from three statistical models of nominal private sector regular
average weekly earnings growth, including a wage equation based on Yellen (2017) , a wage equation based on
Haldane (2018)  and a simple error-correction model based on productivity, inflation expectations and slack. The slack
measure for these models is based on the MPC’s estimate of the unemployment gap. The projections are dynamic,
multi-step ahead forecasts beginning at a point within the models’  estimation periods and are sensitive to data revisions,
which can lead to changes in the swathe over the past as well as over the forecast period.
