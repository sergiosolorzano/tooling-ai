Businesses are reporting a decline in credit availability. The credit availability balance in
the Deloitte CFO Survey, which covers large companies, has fallen, although it remains
significantly above the levels seen during the global financial crisis. Data from the latest
Federation of Small Businesses Index suggest that credit availability is tightening for
SMEs, although fewer than half of UK SMEs use any external financing, according to the
2023 Q2 BVA BDRC SME Finance Monitor. In the CCS, lenders reported that credit
availability to the corporate sector was largely unchanged in 2023 Q3.
The FPC has judged that the tightening of lending standards seen over recent quarters
reflects increased credit risk, rather than defensive actions by banks to protect their
capital positions (Financial Policy Summary and Record – October 2023).
Growth in mortgage lending has been falling, and is approaching the low rates seen
immediately following the global financial crisis. This lower growth has been driven by a
reduction in gross mortgage lending, with repayments by mortgagors broadly flat.
Mortgage approvals have been somewhat lower than the 2010–19 average, suggesting
subdued lending volumes will continue in the near term. Section 3.3 discusses the impact
of higher interest rates on the housing market, and how that affects the outlook for
demand.
Net finance raised by companies continues to be weak, driven in part by subdued demand
for credit. A majority of lenders in the CCS reported that demand for corporate lending had
contracted in 2023 Q3, continuing a broad trend over the previous four quarters. In the
year to September, UK non-financial companies made net repayments of around £17
billion of financing, well below the 2010–19 average for the same point in the year of a
roughly £10 billion increase in borrowing. Weakness in net bank lending is particularly
pronounced among SMEs. Much of this is due to continued repayment of borrowing under
Covid loan schemes.
Broad money growth has continued to slow. The annual growth rate fell to -4.2% in
September. The sharp decline in the latest month largely reflects base effects related to a
large increase in broad money one year ago, associated with developments at liability-
driven investment funds. The growth rate of M4 excluding other financial corporations fell
by less, to -0.7% (Chart 2.7). More generally, money growth is well below the 2010–19
average of 3.8% and has decelerated significantly since 2020–21. The slowing in moneyCredit volumes are subdued for both households and businesses, in part
reflecting weak demand for credit.
Money growth has continued to slow.
