2: Current economic conditions
Global growth continues to be subdued, with stronger growth in the US of fset by
weaker growth in the euro area. Consumer price inflation remains elevated in
advanced economies, but it has been falling this year. Global export prices are
declining, reflecting lower energy prices, the continued clearing of supply chain
bottlenecks and weak producer price inflation. The paths for policy rates implied by
financial markets suggest rates are at or near their peaks in the UK, US and euro
area.
UK economic growth is slowing. Based on the steer from a range of business
surveys, the level of GDP is expected to increase only slightly over 2023 H2,
weaker than the growth over 2023 H1, and the projection in the August Report.
Some of this slowing is likely to reflect the impact of the tightening in monetary
policy that has been needed to combat high inflation.
The labour market remains tight but there are clear signs of loosening, with the
slowdown in output growth feeding into a softening of labour demand and an easing
of recruitment difficulties. Despite that loosening, all indicators suggest that nominal
wage growth is still very high. But the recent rise in the official measure of pay
growth is not matched by other wage data, and forward-looking indicators suggest
that wage growth will fall back in 2024.
Since the August Report, CPI inflation has fallen, dropping from 7.9% in June to
6.7% in September, 0.3 percentage points lower than the projection in August. It
remains well above the MPCâ€™s 2% target, however. Inflation is expected to fall
further to 4.6% in 2023 Q4 and 4.4% in 2024 Q1. The majority of that near-term
decline is accounted for by a falling contribution from household gas and electricity
bills. Falling input price inflation is likely to reduce both consumer goods price
inflation and food price inflation, while services price inflation is projected to remain
elevated in the near term.
