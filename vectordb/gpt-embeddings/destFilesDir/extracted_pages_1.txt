Monetary policy at the Bank of England  
The objectives of monetary policy  
The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to keep inflation low and 
stable, which supports growth and jobs. Subject to maintaining price stability, the MPC is also 
required to support the Government’s economic policy.  
The Government has set the MPC a target for the 12-month increase in the Consumer Prices 
Index of 2%.  
The 2% inflation target is symmetric and applies at all times.  
The MPC’s remit  recognises, however, that the actual inflation rate will depart from its target 
as a result of shocks and disturba nces, and that attempts to keep inflation at target in these 
circumstances may cause undesirable volatility in output. In exceptional circumstances, the 
appropriate horizon for returning inflation to target can vary. The MPC will communicate how 
and when i t intends to return inflation to the target.  
The instruments of monetary policy  
The MPC currently uses two main monetary policy tools. First, we set the interest rate that 
banks and building societies earn on deposits, or ‘reserves’, placed with the Bank o f England 
–this is Bank  Rate. Second, we can buy government and corporate bonds, financed by the
issuance of central bank reserves – this is asset purchases or quantitative easing.  
The Monetary Policy Report  
The MPC is committed to clear, transparent comm unication. The Monetary Policy Report 
(MPR) is a key part of that. It allows the MPC to share its thinking and explain the reasons for 
its decisions.  
The Report is produced quarterly by Bank staff under the guidance of the members of the 
MPC.  
This Report has been prepared and published by the Bank of England in accordance with 
section 18 of the Bank of England Act 1998.
