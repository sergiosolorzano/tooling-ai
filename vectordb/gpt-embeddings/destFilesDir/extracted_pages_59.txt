Alongside labour market tightness and wage growth, services CPI inflation is one of the
MPC’s key indicators of domestic inflationary pressure. Services inflation stood at 6.9% in
September, 0.1 percentage points below the August forecast. There was some volatility in
services inflation over the summer due to travel-related components such as airfares and
accommodation. Excluding these components, services inflation has been more stable
since April. An underlying measure of services inflation produced by Bank staff, which is
determined by the comovement of price changes across services components to strip out
idiosyncratic fluctuations, has begun to fall back slightly in recent months but remains high
(Chart 2.18).
Services inflation is expected to remain broadly stable throughout 2023 Q4, before
increasing temporarily in January 2024. Large and unusual falls in a number of services
prices at the beginning of 2023 are unlikely to be repeated, resulting in a positive base
effect.Chart 2.17: Producer price inflation suggests cost pressures for goods are easing

(a) The output PPI series is the headline ONS measure for manufacturing output producer prices. The PPI series has
been mean and variance adjusted to match the corresponding CPI series between 2012 and 2019. The latest data point
is September 2023 and the projection is to March 2024.
…and to a lesser extent services inflation, which, after a projected spike in
January, is expected to moderate as pay growth and other input costs fall.
