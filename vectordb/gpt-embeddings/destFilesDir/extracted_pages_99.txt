3.4: Conclusion
As set out above, income growth, saving behaviour, and the impact of higher Bank Rate
are key factors affecting demand in the economy at the moment. In the MPC’s central
projection, GDP growth stays below historical averages over the forecast period. This
reflects the restrictive stance of monetary policy, which weighs to an increasing extent on
the level of demand, although the impact on quarterly GDP growth is currently around its
peak. A margin of slack opens up in the economy, which helps to bring inflation back to
the 2% target. The projection for demand, and the risks around it, are discussed in more
detail in Key judgement 1 in Section 1.In the MPC’s central projection, demand growth remains weak by historical
standards. A margin of slack opens up which helps to bring inflation back to the
2% target.
