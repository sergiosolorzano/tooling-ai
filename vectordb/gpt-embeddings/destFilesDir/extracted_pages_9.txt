1.1: The conditioning assumptions underlying the MPC ’s
projections
As set out in Table 1.B, the MPC’s projections are conditioned on:
The paths for policy rates in advanced economies implied by financial markets, as
captured in the 15-working day average of forward interest rates to 24 October (Chart
2.5). The market-implied path for Bank Rate in the United Kingdom has fallen by just
over ½ percentage point on average over the next three years compared with the
equivalent period at the time of the August Report. The path for Bank Rate
underpinning the November projections remains around 5¼% until 2024 Q3 and then
declines gradually to 4¼% by the end of 2026. There has been a significant increase in
longer-term government bond yields globally since August (Section 2.1).A path for the sterling effective exchange rate index that is around 1½% lower on
average than in the August Report, and is depreciating gradually over the forecast
period given the role for expected interest rate differentials in the Committee’s
conditioning assumption.Wholesale energy prices that follow their respective futures curves over the forecast
period. Since August, spot oil prices and the oil futures curve have risen, while gas
futures prices are little changed. Significant uncertainty remains around the outlook for
wholesale energy prices, including related to recent geopolitical developments (Key
judgement 3).UK household energy prices that move in line with Bank staff estimates of the Ofgem
price cap implied by the path of wholesale energy prices (Section 2.3).
Fiscal policy that evolves in line with announced UK government policies to date, and
so does not include the contents of the Autumn Statement on 22 November.
