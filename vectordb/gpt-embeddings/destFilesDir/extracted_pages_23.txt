Chart 1.4: CPI inflation projection based on market interest rate expectations, other
policy measures as announced
The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for CPI inflation in the future. It has been conditioned on Bank
Rate following a path implied by market yields, but allows the Committee’ s judgement on the risks around the other
conditioning assumptions set out in Section 1.1, including wholesale energy prices, to af fect the calibration of the fan
chart skew. If economic circumstances identical to today’s were to prevail on 100 occasions, the MPC’s best collective
judgement is that inflation in any particular quarter would lie within the darkest central band on only 30 of those
occasions. The fan chart is constructed so that outturns of inflation are also expected to lie within each pair of the lighter
orange areas on 30 occasions. In any particular quarter of the forecast period, inflation is therefore expected to lie
somewhere within the fans on 90 out of 100 occasions. And on the remaining 10 out of 100 occasions inflation can fall
anywhere outside the orange area of the fan chart. Over the forecast period, this has been depicted by the grey
background. See the Box on pages 48–49 of the May 2002 Inflation Report for a fuller description of the fan chart and
what it represents.
