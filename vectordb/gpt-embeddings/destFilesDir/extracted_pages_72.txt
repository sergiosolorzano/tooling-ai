Box D : Agents ’ update on business conditions
The key information from Agents’ contacts considered by the Monetary Policy
Committee at its November meeting is presented in this box, which summarises
intelligence gathered in the six weeks to mid-October.
In line with the September Agents’ update, many areas of the economy continued to
report weak activity. In some areas such as housing, commercial real estate,
consumer goods, business services and manufacturing, contacts suggested there
had been a further softening in activity.
Employment intentions have weakened a little further, but overall remained
consistent with broadly stable headcount in the coming year. Recruitment difficulties
have continued to ease, although skill shortages were still a concern for some.
Goods inflation is slowing more quickly than for services as input cost pressures
continue to ease.
For consumer goods, volumes have mostly been flat, including for clothing and
beauty items. But they have fallen sharply over the past year for furniture,
technology, and home improvement products, likely a consequence of increased
spending on these during the pandemic.
Price inflation has sustained revenue growth at pubs and restaurants as the number
of customers has fallen. Following a generally good summer, contacts in the
hospitality sector were worried about demand falling more over the coming months
than is usual for the time of year. Bookings for hotels and other tourist venues were
being made later than usual reflecting greater consumer caution.
Contacts reported that households have also been cutting back the size of their
entertainment and data packages and spending less on telecoms, such as ending
landline contracts and upgrading mobile phones less frequently.
Overall, contacts remained pessimistic about the outlook, with most expecting weak
volume growth over the coming year.While still positive, nominal growth in consumer spending is weakening, in
line with lower inflation. Growth in consumer spending volumes remained
subdued. Spending on services appeared to be outperforming goods.
