A stronger labour market supports household demand directly, through higher household
labour incomes, and indirectly as a result of greater consumer confidence, partly from
lower worries about job security. As shown in Chart 3.2, employment growth has
contributed positively to annual real labour income growth throughout 2022 and 2023, with
a peak contribution in 2023 of 1.2 percentage points in April. The tightness of the labour
market is also estimated to have pushed up nominal wage growth (Chart 2.14). Although
these factors have been outweighed in 2023 by the fall in energy prices and the
commensurate easing in inflation, they remain an important determinant of labour
incomes.
There is a range of potential explanations for this resilience in the labour market. One is
‘labour hoarding’: the Bank’s Agents report that, in response to past heightened
recruitment difficulties, some businesses have kept employment levels higher than they
would have done otherwise.
There are some early signs that the resilience in the labour market has started to wane,
suggesting the support for income growth might also lessen at some point. Some
indicators of employment growth have weakened over time and the unemployment rate
has risen to 4.2%, based on the ONS’ experimental estimate of unemployment (Section
2.2). Since the peak in the vacancies to unemployment ratio in 2022, much of the
reduction in labour demand has been reflected in falling vacancies. But the recent rise in
unemployment may indicate that more of the adjustment in the future will be through job
losses, or weaker employment growth, which would reduce aggregate household income.
In contrast, nominal wage growth is projected to remain high and above inflation in the
near term, supporting real labour income growth.…but unemployment has started to pick up.
