In the mean projection conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates
at 5.25% over the forecast period, CPI inflation is expected to be 2.0% and 1.6% in two
years’ and three years’ time respectively. This constant rate projection also returns
inflation to the 2% target three quarters earlier than the mean market rate forecast.
