saving ratio is expected to be broadly unchanged over much of the forecast period, flatter
than the downward-sloping path projected in the August Report. That reflects a higher
degree of precautionary saving than expected previously, in part owing to the higher
profile for unemployment (Key judgement 2), and is broadly consistent with the
Committee’s decision in this forecast to reduce somewhat the scale of its judgement
boosting expected spending.
In large part reflecting the transmission of higher interest rates (Section 3.3), housing
investment is expected to fall significantly, by 5¾% in 2023, by 6¾% 2024 and by 2¾% in
2025. This profile is similar to that in the August Report, and is consistent with weakness
in housing transactions and forward-looking indicators of new housing construction.
Business investment is projected to increase by just under 7% this year , but to fall by 1%
in 2024, in part reflecting transport sector related volatility in capital expenditure. As set
out in Box D, respondents to a special survey by the Bank’s Agents expect investment
growth to slow slightly next year but remain positive. Investment intentions are being held
back by economic uncertainty, and by the cost and availability of finance, but supported by
the need to invest for a number of reasons such as digitalisation, ef ficiency, sustainability
and maintenance. Further out in the latest projection, business investment is expected to
be broadly flat in 2025, before increasing by 2% in 2026.
There are risks in both directions around the central projections for household spending
and GDP, including related to the Committee’s decision in this forecast to scale back
somewhat the extent of its judgement to boost expected demand. Spending could be
stronger than expected if there is greater resilience in labour market activity (Key
judgement 2) and some households choose to save less or run down existing stocks of
savings to a greater extent. Conversely, demand could be weaker than expected if some
people become more worried about their job security and try to build up their savings to a
greater extent. The latest Bank/NMG survey suggests that, among those who are
planning to change their saving habits compared with the previous six months, the share
of households who are planning to save more than usual over the next six months is
expected to rise to around half (Chart 3.5).
There are also risks related to the transmission of monetary policy , including the response
of consumption to higher interest rates. Although there is a much greater proportion of
fixed-rate mortgages than in previous tightening cycles, some mortgagors who anticipate
needing to refinance in the future may take greater advance actions to prepare for facingThe risks around the projection for UK GDP growth are judged to be broadly
balanced.
