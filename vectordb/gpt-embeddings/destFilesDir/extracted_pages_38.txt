Headline inflation rates in the UK, euro area and US have all fallen this year . This largely
reflects lower energy price inflation, although food and goods price inflation have also
declined, particularly in the US. Nonetheless, inflation remains above central bank targets.
In the US, the annual rate of PCE inflation was 3.4% in September , while in the euro area
the HICP inflation rate fell to 2.9% in the flash estimate for October. Underlying inflationary
pressures have remained elevated across the three regions. Services inflation remains
high, as does wage growth. Measures such as the vacancies to unemployment ratio
suggest that labour markets remain tighter than before the pandemic, even with the recent
loosening in the US and in the UK.
Global export price inflation has eased markedly over the past year , with prices falling
across regions in 2023 Q2 (Chart 2.3). This reflects the indirect effects of lower energy
prices, the continued clearing of supply chain bottlenecks and weak producer price
inflation. Measures of shipping costs have stabilised around their levels before the
pandemic, having been significantly elevated in 2021–22.Consumer price inflation in advanced economies remains elevated, but it is
