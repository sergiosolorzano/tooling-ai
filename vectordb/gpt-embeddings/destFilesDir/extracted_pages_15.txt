higher interest costs. There could also be non-linearities in the response of consumption
to weakness in the housing market via collateral and other channels (Section 3.3). These
could, in turn, relate to developments in unemployment and mortgage distress.
Internationally, the risk of higher commodity prices, including related to geopolitical
developments, could lead to weaker UK economic activity as well as upward pressure on
CPI inflation (Key judgement 3).
1.2: Key judgement 2
The margin of excess demand in the UK economy has diminished over recent
quarters and an increasing degree of economic slack is expected to emerge from
the start of next year. Unemployment is expected to rise further over the forecast
period and exceed the Committee’s upwardly revised estimate of the medium-term
equilibrium rate from the end of next year.
As set out in Box C, the upward revisions to GDP in Blue Book 2023 provide limited news
about the balance of demand and supply in the market sector economy , and hence
domestic inflationary pressures (Key judgement 3). In light of that, the MPC has judged it
appropriate to revise up potential supply in line with the revisions to measured GDP , such
that the output gap over the past is unchanged.
The Committee continues to judge that there has been a significant margin of excess
demand in the economy over the past two years, averaging just under 1% of potential
GDP, and in part reflecting the weakness of potential supply. That excess demand has
been accounted for by the tightness of the labour market and, prior to 2023, a higher than
normal degree of capacity utilisation within companies.
Since around the middle of last year, however, the margin of aggregate excess demand is
judged to have been diminishing, such that only a little remains currently . This is
consistent with the recent loss of momentum in activity (Key judgement 1) and with other
top-down cross-checks of the degree of slack in the economy. Compared with the August
Report, the decline in excess demand is judged to be occurring a little faster during the
second half of this year than expected previously.
The MPC is continuing to consider the collective steer from a wide range of data to inform
its view on labour market developments. As discussed in Box B, there are increased
uncertainties around the ONS’s official labour market activity data that have previously
been based on the Labour Force Survey (LFS). A decline in response rates has resulted
