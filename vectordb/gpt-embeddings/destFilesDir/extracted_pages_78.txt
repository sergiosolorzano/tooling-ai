3: In focus – The outlook for demand
In the face of the series of significant shocks that have hit the UK economy in
recent years, demand growth has proved relatively resilient (Section 3.1). Several
factors have been important in supporting that resilience, including a strong labour
market, falling energy prices and fiscal support from the Government, all of which
have boosted household real income (Section 3.2). There are increasing signs that
the restrictive stance of monetary policy needed to combat the elevated inflation
caused by the original economic shocks is now reducing demand through a range
of channels (Section 3.3). The evolution of those factors which have been
supporting the economy will be the key influence on how demand, and hence
inflation, develops. In the MPC’s central projection, demand growth remains below
historical averages as higher interest rates weigh on activity, a margin of slack
opens up, and inflation is brought back to target (Section 3.4 and Section 1).
3.1: Recent developments in GDP
Between the end of 2022 and August 2023, the UK economy grew by 0.6%. That
represents slow growth compared to historical norms. However, in the context of the
sequence of supply shocks that have hit the UK economy ((Bailey (2023 )), including the
energy price spike following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the economy has shown more
resilience than many expected. Chart 3.1 shows the evolution of forecasts for 2023
calendar year growth, with the Bank’s forecasts in aqua and the average forecast from the
HM Treasury survey of independent forecasters in orange. In 2022 and early 2023, the
consensus was that the economy would be in recession in 2023. Expectations are now
that the economy will grow slightly across 2023. Much of this improvement reflects a
recovery from the supply shocks, and in particular the fall in energy prices. However , over
this time, the MPC has also adjusted the conditioning assumptions upon which its
forecasts are constructed and made a series of judgements to increase its projections of
demand. These judgements include the possibility of lower precautionary saving by
households than previously assumed, in turn related to a lower risk of job loss given the
continued strength in labour market activity (Section 1).GDP growth has been stronger than previously anticipated during the first half of
2023 but recent data suggest GDP growth has started to slow.
