growth has been higher than standard models would have predicted (Chart 2.14), which
could be explained by a rise in the medium-term equilibrium unemployment rate. For
example, the rate may have increased if employees and domestic firms have sought
compensation in the form of higher nominal pay and domestic selling prices for the
reductions in real incomes that they have experienced after the terms of trade shock.
There is also some evidence that the efficiency with which vacancies are matched to
those seeking work has decreased in recent years. In its November forecast, the MPC
has made a judgement to further increase the medium-term equilibrium unemployment
rate since the sharp rise in energy prices – it is judged to be around 4½% currently (Key
judgement 2 in Section 1).Chart 2.12: The labour market remains tight, although it has loosened since mid-

use the official LFS estimates to June 2023 and thereafter use the ONS’s experimental alternative labour market
statistics (based on claimant count data). See Box B for further information.
