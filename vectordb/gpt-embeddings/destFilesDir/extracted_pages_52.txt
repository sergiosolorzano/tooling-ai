2.3: Wage growth and inﬂation
Alongside labour market tightness and services CPI inflation, the MPC monitors various
measures of wage growth as they could indicate independent evidence of more persistent
domestic inflationary pressures. The ONS measure of annual private sector regular
average weekly earnings (AWE) growth was 8.0% in August. This was 0.8 percentage
points higher than expected in the August Report, largely accounted for by upward
revisions to previous months’ data. This measure had been on an upward trend between
February and June, before falling back slightly in July and August.
Other pay indicators have been more stable at rates of growth that are also high, but do
not show a further rise in recent months (Chart 2.13). According to the DMP, annual pay
increases have been steady at around 7% between April and October. HMRCDespite a loosening labour market, nominal wage growth is still high.

Measures of annual private sector wage growth (a)

(a) The adjusted HMRC Real Time Information (RTI) measure strips out pay in sectors with a high share of public
workers, such as public administration and defence, social security , education, health and social work, to proxy private
sector wage developments. In contrast to the AWE measure of private sector regular pay, RTI data include bonus
payments. The latest data are for August 2023 (ONS private sector regular pay), September 2023 (HMRC RTI and
Indeed Wage Tracker) and October 2023 (Bank DMP) respectively.
While all measures of pay growth are elevated, the recent rise in the annual rate of
growth of private sector regular AWE is not matched by other indicators.
