larger sample size. The ONS plans to transition to the TLFS estimates in March
2024. [1]
Due to concerns around the impact of the fall in the response rates on the quality of
the data, the ONS has temporarily stopped publishing LFS estimates of
employment, unemployment and inactivity following the June 2023 data. The ONS
has announced that it plans to resume publication of its LFS estimates in
December, but in the meantime it has replaced them with experimental estimates.
These figures take the LFS estimates for unemployment and employment in the
three months to June, and thereafter project them forward in line with the claimant
count measure of unemployment and HMRC payrolls data respectively . As
experimental statistics, these estimates need to be interpreted with caution
(especially given both the HMRC payrolls data and the claimant count measure are
themselves experimental statistics). The Office for Statistics Regulation is
undertaking a review of these data.
The population weights that the ONS uses to produce the latest LFS estimates
assume that the demographics of the population have not changed since June
2021. Updating for recent demographic changes will affect estimates of the rates of
participation, employment and unemployment in the labour market. For example,
the current LFS population weights do not account for the ageing in the population
since mid-2021, and as a result older people have been progressively
underweighted in the LFS estimates. As older people are more likely to be out of
the labour force, this means that the estimates of the participation rate and
employment rate are probably too high.
The existing population weights used in the LFS are also based on a mid-2021
assumption about the size and growth of the population. They do not therefore
capture more recent information about the population, such as greater than
assumed inward migration. Because the UK population is now estimated to have
increased since mid-2021 by more than assumed in the LFS, the total number of
people estimated to be in employment, unemployment and outside of the workforce
in the UK is expected to be revised up, all else equal.The ONS has temporarily paused the publication of LFS estimates from the
June data, and replaced them with experimental estimates.
LFS estimates are also based on mid-2021 population estimates, and will be
revised to reflect more up to date estimates later this year.
