Based on ONS data to August, UK GDP is expected to have been flat in 2023 Q3, weaker
than expected in August. Output growth was volatile within the quarter, in part reflecting
the impact of strikes and poor weather. Monthly output was estimated to have fallen by
0.6% in July before rebounding slightly in August, increasing by 0.2% on the month.
Breaking down GDP by expenditure category (Chart 2.8), housing investment is expected
to have continued to contribute negatively to growth in 2023 Q3, as higher interest rates
weighed on house building and housing transactions. Business investment is also
expected to have dragged on growth: strong business investment in the first half of the
year was partly driven by volatile components such as aircraft investment, and that is
expected to unwind. Household consumption is expected to have continued to contribute
positively to GDP growth, though to a lesser extent than in 2023 H1. Positive real income
growth is expected to have provided some support to household spending, while higher
interest rates have reduced consumption through a range of channels (Section 3).Chart 2.8: GDP is expected to be broadly flat in 2023 H2
