in the ONS temporarily ceasing to publish LFS estimates of employment, unemployment
and inactivity from the June data. The ONS has, however, published experimental
estimates of employment and unemployment that need to be interpreted with caution.
As discussed in Box B, the Committee is therefore continuing to consider the collective
steer from other indicators of labour market activity. Generally speaking, the Committee
has a wider set of indicators to draw on for its understanding of developments in
employment than it does for developments in the split of non-employment between
unemployment and inactivity.
Taken together, a range of indicators suggest that employment growth is likely to have
softened over the second half of this year to a greater extent than expected in the August
Report, but not turned negative (Section 2.2). Developments in indicators of recruitment
difficulties point to a loosening in the labour market. Contacts of the Bank’s Agents have
also reported an easing in hiring constraints, although persistent skills shortages remain in
some sectors.
Recent LFS data issues notwithstanding, the unemployment rate is expected to be around
4¼% during the second half of 2023, slightly higher than expected in the August Report.
On this basis, the vacancies to unemployment ratio, an alternative measure of labour
market tightness, has continued to decline.
As discussed in the August Report, there is significant uncertainty about the rate of
unemployment consistent with meeting the 2% inflation target in the medium term. Higher-
than-expected wage growth after the recent terms of trade shock to the economy
suggests that the medium-term equilibrium rate is likely to be temporarily higher , as
employees and domestic firms have sought compensation in the form of higher nominal
pay and domestic selling prices for the reductions in real incomes that they have
experienced. There is also some evidence that the efficiency with which vacancies are
matched to those seeking work has decreased over recent years, which would be pushing
up more structurally on the equilibrium rate of unemployment. In its November forecast,
the Committee has made an additional judgement to increase its estimate of the medium-
term equilibrium rate of unemployment from the period since the energy shock started
and, to a lesser degree, over the forecast period. This equilibrium rate is judged to be
around 4½% currently. This change in judgement is consistent with a somewhat stronger
outlook for wage growth and domestic inflationary pressures all else equal (Key
judgement 3).
