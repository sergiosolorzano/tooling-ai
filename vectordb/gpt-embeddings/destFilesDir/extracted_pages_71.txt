The revisions to GDP were concentrated in the public sector and, specifically, the
healthcare industry where output had been particularly hard to measure during the
pandemic. They reflected new data sources and measurement improvements.
Revisions to overall market sector output were small. Within the market sector ,
upward revisions to the wholesale and retail trade industry were largely of fset by
downward revisions to industrial production.
Revisions to historic estimates of GDP are not typically judged to have implications
for the balance between demand and supply and hence inflationary pressures,
since inflation outturns remain the same. In addition, these particular Blue Book
revisions are almost entirely accounted for by changes to public sector output and
so contain little news about the balance of supply and demand in the market sector
economy, which is more relevant for assessing inflationary pressures. In light of
that, the MPC has judged it appropriate to revise up potential supply in line with the
revisions to measured GDP, such that the balance between them over the past is
unchanged.Upward revisions to public sector output were sizable; estimates of total
market sector output were little changed.
These revisions do not have implications for the MPCâ€™s assessment of the
balance between demand and supply over the past and hence underlying
inflationary pressures.
