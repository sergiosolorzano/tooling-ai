Bank staff take a combined steer from a wide range of indicators to inform their view
about underlying employment growth. Daniell and Moreira (2023) describes how these
indicators feed into the near-term forecast and the evolution of this indicator-based model
forecast over time is shown in the aqua line in Chart 2.11. The indicator-based model
suggests that employment growth has slowed gradually since end-2021. The latest staff
projections suggest employment will be broadly flat over the second half of 2023.Chart 2.10: Most indicators of employment growth are softening

ONS, S&P Global/CIPS and Bank calculations.
(a) ONS employment growth is the change in headline employment level for people aged 16+ over the value three
months earlier. Employment indicators include data from: ONS/HMRC Pay As You Earn (the three-month change in the
monthly number of PAYE employees), the Bank’s Agents (employment intentions over the next six months);
KPMG/REC/S&P Global (weighting together the temporary and permanent staff placements series); Lloyds Business
Barometer (balance of higher staffing levels over next 12 months); and S&P Global/CIPS (PMI composite employment
index). The surveys and Agents’ scores have varying samples and questions but have been mean and variance
adjusted to match the ONS employment growth series between 2000 and 2019, and are therefore shown consistent
with the three-month on three-month growth rate. The final data point for ONS employment growth is the three months
to August 2023.
(b) The LFS employment growth series shown here uses official LFS estimates to June 2023 and thereafter uses the
ONS’s experimental alternative labour market statistics (based on HMRC payrolls data). See Box B for further
information.
