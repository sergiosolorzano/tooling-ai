The MPC will continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures
and resilience in the economy as a whole, including a range of measures of the
underlying tightness of labour market conditions, wage growth and services price inflation.
Monetary policy will need to be sufficiently restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation
to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with the Committee’ s remit. The
MPC’s latest projections indicate that monetary policy is likely to need to be restrictive for
an extended period of time. Further tightening in monetary policy would be required if
there were evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures.
