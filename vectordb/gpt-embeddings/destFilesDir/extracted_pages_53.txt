administrative data on payrolls suggest that median private sector pay growth was broadly
flat at around 7% in the months leading up to September. The Indeed Wage Tracker,
which measures the average annual change in the wages stated in job adverts, points to
wage growth falling back slightly to around 7% between April and September. Meanwhile,
contacts of the Bank’s Agents continue to report that average annual pay settlements
were in the region of 6% to 6.5%.
The AWE data are based on the Monthly Wages and Salaries Survey (MWSS), covering a
representative sample of 9,000 firms with more than 20 employees. The MWSS is
separate from the LFS and is not subject to falling response rates because firms are
legally obliged to respond. Some of the recent divergence between the AWE measure and
the other indicators could reflect sampling variability or differences in methodology and
data coverage. For example, the MWSS and other surveys can be af fected by differences
in the characteristics of surveyed firms and the full population of firms, while the HMRC
RTI estimates are based on the PAYE system that collects income tax and national
insurance from employment and therefore covers all firms. In addition, in contrast to
HMRC RTI median pay growth, the AWE measure of average pay growth will be sensitive
to changes in pay across the whole wage distribution.
The MPC will continue to monitor all data on pay growth. While the recent rise in the
annual rate of growth of private sector regular AWE is not mirrored in other indicators, all
pay measures continue to signal that wage growth is high and, if sustained, not consistent
with inflation returning to target in the medium term.
Labour market tightness has played a role in elevated nominal wage growth to date, and
the August 2023 Report  highlighted tentative evidence that it explains some of the wide
variation in pay growth across sectors. The unexplained strength in pay growth recently
may reflect a rise in the medium-term equilibrium unemployment rate (Section 2.2), as
well as stronger second-round effects of external cost shocks on inflation in wages and
domestic prices. With the labour market now loosening, and inflation set to moderate,
some of the upward pressures on wage growth should ease in 2024.
Wage growth tends to rise when headline inflation and inflation expectations increase.
Near-term inflation expectations in particular tend to be strongly correlated with current
headline inflation (Chart 2.19). Rising headline inflation, and the associated increase inA looser labour market and falling inflation are expected to contribute to a
moderation in wage growth…
