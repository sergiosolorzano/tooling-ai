Revenue growth in many areas of business services has continued to be subdued.
Mergers and acquisitions activity has remained weak, demand for logistics has
softened with container imports down compared with last year and property service
revenues have fallen, in line with declining commercial real estate transactions.
Even accountancy, law and consultancy services, where demand had been holding
up, were now reporting a softening as clients become more circumspect on
discretionary spending. Contacts were concerned that turnover growth could soften
further over the winter, although some expected demand to pick up in 2024 H1 as
funding costs stabilised.
Manufacturing volumes fell slightly. This is weaker than in the Agentsâ€™ September
update on business conditions, when contacts reported that volumes were flat.
Domestic demand has eased, with demand falling for homewares and construction
products, although some sectors such as aerospace, renewables and defence,
chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and energy were still seeing growing demand
supported by exports. Consumer-facing manufacturers cited weakening in order
books as a sign that volumes would decline over the year ahead.
Weakening demand, high costs and lower returns have led to a continued decline in
construction output. Private sector activity has slowed sharply, while public sector
activity has moderated. The pace of decline in construction output could increase
over the winter, given uncertainty about private sector project rates of return and
increasing pressure on public sector budgets.
Contacts reported that higher mortgage rates and expectations of further house
price falls were increasingly weighing on housing demand, with reductions of
around 20% in transactions and 5% in prices having occurred relative to a year ago.
Most expected broadly similar falls in prices over the year ahead. Mortgage
approval numbers have declined further and were expected to continue to do so
over the coming year. There was no pickup in mortgage arrears, but the credit
profile of applicants has worsened owing to weaker disposable income.
Rental demand has remained strong, well in excess of supply, pushing new rents
up by double digits on a year ago. One contributing factor was the higher cost of
mortgage borrowing, which was making rents relatively less expensive, further
stimulating rental demand.The declining trends in housing demand and housing starts have
intensified. Rental demand has remained strong.
