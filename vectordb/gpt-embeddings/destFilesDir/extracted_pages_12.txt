As in recent projections, and taking account of all announced government plans, the
positive impacts of past fiscal loosening measures related to the pandemic and the energy
price shock (Section 3.1) on the level of GDP unwind, which pulls down on GDP growth
throughout much of the forecast period. Real government consumption is, nevertheless,
expected to grow quite strongly in 2024, bouncing back from the negative impact on
spending associated with public sector strike activity in 2023.
International growth has remained subdued (Section 2.1) and the path of global GDP  is
expected to be broadly similar to that in the August Report. In the MPC’s November
projection, annual UK-weighted world GDP growth is projected to rise from around 1½%
in 2023 to around 2% in the medium term (Table 1.D). That compares with average
annual growth of around 2½% in the decade prior to the pandemic.
Although aggregate global growth is evolving largely as expected, US GDP  growth has
been stronger than expected, while the euro area has seen weaker growth. As in the
United Kingdom, the impact of past monetary policy tightening is dragging on activity , with
fiscal policy and the rundown of excess household saving underpinning the resilience of
US demand. Growth in the euro area is expected to pick up over the forecast period, while
growth in the United States and China is projected to fall back somewhat.
Overall in the Committee’s November projection, UK GDP is projected to remain broadly
flat in the first half of the forecast period. As well as the impact of higher interest rates, this
reflects a waning boost from fiscal policy and relatively weak potential supply (Key
judgement 1 in the February 2023 Report and Key judgement 2 in this Report). GDP
growth recovers over the second half of the forecast period, although it remains well
below historical averages in the medium term. Calendar-year GDP growth is expected to
be marginally positive in 2024, and to increase by ¼% in 2025 and by ¾% in 2026 (T able
1.D). Four-quarter GDP growth picks up to slightly over 1% by 2026 Q4 (Chart 1.1).
Relative to the August Report projection, four-quarter GDP growth is expected to be
slightly weaker throughout the forecast period. Abstracting from the increase in the
historical level of GDP related to the Blue Book 2023 revisions (Box C), the level of GDP
has been revised down by around 1% by the end of the forecast period compared with the
August Report. That lower level of activity reflects recent weaker-than-expected GDP data
and the Committee’s related decision in this forecast to reduce somewhat its previous
judgement boosting expected demand. Those factors have been offset partially by the
projected boost to GDP from the lower path of market interest rates on which the forecast
is conditioned and, to a lesser degree, the estimated impact on growth of the recent
exchange rate depreciation (Section 1.1).
