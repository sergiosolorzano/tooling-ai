reasons, including the upside risks around the outlook for demand (Key judgement 1).
Conversely, the labour market could loosen more rapidly than assumed, again including
because of any downside risks to demand.
There also remains significant uncertainty around the Committee’ s updated assumption
for the path of the equilibrium rate of unemployment, news in which would, holding
demand fixed, have implications for labour market tightness and inflationary pressures. In
particular, it is difficult to judge how quickly some of the factors pushing up the equilibrium
rate recently could fade over the forecast period, and the extent to which there are greater
structural factors, such as interactions with the benefits system, at play .
1.2: Key judgement 3
Second-round effects in domestic prices and wages are expected to take longer to
unwind than they did to emerge. In the modal forecast conditioned on the market-
implied path of market interest rates, an increasing degree of slack in the economy
and declining external cost pressures lead CPI inflation to return to the 2% target
by the end of 2025 and to fall below target thereafter. The Committee continues to
judge that the risks are skewed to the upside. Taking account of this skew, mean
CPI inflation is 2.2% and 1.9% at the two and three-year horizons respectively .
Twelve-month CPI inflation remains well above the MPC’s 2% target, but has fallen back
to 6.7% in both September and in 2023 Q3 as a whole, below expectations in the August
Report. Most of the downside news since the previous Report reflects lower core goods
price inflation. Services inflation has been only slightly weaker than expected in August.
Twelve-month CPI inflation is expected to continue to fall quite sharply in the near term, to
below 5% in October, as the reduction in the Ofgem household energy price cap more
than offsets the impact on motor fuel costs of the recent rise in sterling oil prices (Section
2.3). CPI inflation is projected to decline to an average of 4.6% in 2023 Q4, slightly lower
than expected in the August Report, and then to 4.4% in 2024 Q1 and 3.6% in 2024 Q2
(Table 1.C). This decline is expected to be accounted for by lower energy, core goods and
food price inflation and, beyond January, by some fall in services price inflation.
Based on the latest paths of oil and gas futures prices, the direct energy contribution to
inflation is slightly higher throughout the forecast period than in the Committee’ s previous
forecast. In absolute terms, this direct energy contribution remains slightly negative over
the second half of the forecast period.
