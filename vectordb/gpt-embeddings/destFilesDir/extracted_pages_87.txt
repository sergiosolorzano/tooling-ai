Indeed, Chart 3.5 shows that among households who have changed their saving habits
over the past six months, the share of households who are planning to save less than
usual falls from two thirds to a half or under.
Other ways in which households can maintain their spending include borrowing and
raising hours worked. And there is some evidence more households are using credit to
support consumption. Data from the ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey show that the
share of people using credit to cope with high inflation has risen from 1 1% in early 2022 to
16% in the most recent data. However, overall growth in lending in the economy has
slowed significantly; for households this has been driven by a slowdown in mortgage
lending (Section 2.1) outweighing continued growth in consumer credit. There is also
evidence from the latest NMG survey that some households will support consumption by
changing their working arrangements: of those households who are expecting to see their
real incomes fall but plan to cut consumption by less than the fall in their income, 17%
plan to fund that gap by working overtime and 8% plan to move to a better paying job.
Real post-tax household labour income is projected to grow modestly over the forecast
period. There is uncertainty around how household saving behaviour will evolve over the
coming years. Despite a still elevated stock of nominal household deposits, evidence from
both the NMG survey and the likely gradual rise in the unemployment rate point towards
households avoiding running down savings where possible. Therefore, the household
saving ratio is expected to remain broadly unchanged over the MPC’ s forecast period
(Chart 3.6). The relatively slow growth in income means that consumption growth is
expected to be weak throughout the forecast period: calendar-year household spending is
expected to be flat in 2024, and to rise by ½% in 2025 and by just over 1% in 2026
(Section 1).
3.3: The impact of higher interest rates on demand
In order to bring inflation back to target, the MPC has raised Bank Rate significantly since
the start of this tightening cycle and now judges that the current monetary policy stance is
restrictive (Section 1). There are increasing signs of the impact of tighter monetary policy
in the labour market and in momentum in the real economy more generally .Overall, real labour income is projected to grow modestly over the forecast
period, the aggregate saving rate is projected to remain broadly unchanged, and
consumption growth is projected to be weak.
Higher interest rates are expected to reduce demand to an increasing extent.
