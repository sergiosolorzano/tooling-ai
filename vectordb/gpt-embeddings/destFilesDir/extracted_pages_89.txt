Changes in Bank Rate and future interest rate expectations pass-through to changes in
household deposit and loan rates over time. As set out in Section 2.1, pass-through to
rates on new loans has been broadly in line with developments in the relevant reference
rates. In contrast, pass-through to some savings rates has tended to be somewhat slower .
Nevertheless, the direct cash-flow effects of changes in interest rates have increased
average household incomes. This is accounted for by two key factors. First, the stock of
household savings exceeds the stock of mortgages: the outstanding value of mortgages is
a little over £1.5 trillion compared to close to £1.7 trillion in household deposits. That
means for an equivalent change in interest rates the impact on interest income is greater
than the impact on mortgage costs. And second, as set out in the May 2023 Report , overChart 3.7: Increases in interest rates are expected to continue to reduce
consumption
Estimated impact of changes in OIS yield curve since August 2021 on the level of consumption
(a)
(a) OIS rates are the overnight index swap rates and represent market expectations for Bank Rate. Data up to 24
October 2023 are included. Estimates show the output from the standard treatment of the impact of changes in Bank
Rate and Bank Rate expectations in the Bank’s forecasting models. The consumption effects of the estimated impact of
changes in the OIS curve on sterling exchange rates have been excluded. Both the overall total impact and the
individual channel estimates are uncertain and could be higher or lower than presented here. The ‘Mortgage cash flow’
bars include some effect from intertemporal substitution where higher interest rates shift incentives to consume later
than otherwise would be the case. The ‘Other’ bars show the net effect of changes in Bank Rate excluding the direct
mortgage cash-flow channel, intertemporal substitution and broader housing ef fects.
Higher interest rates reduce household consumption via higher mortgage costs,
even though aggregate household incomes have increased.
