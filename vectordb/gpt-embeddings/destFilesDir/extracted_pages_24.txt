CPI inflation 1.9 1.9 1.7 1.6 1.5
In the modal projection conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest
rates at 5.25% over the forecast period, CPI inflation is expected to be 1.7% and 1.2% in
two years’ and three years’ time respectively (Chart 1.5). These are lower than the
Committee’s modal forecasts at the same horizons conditioned on market rates, as the
constant rate assumption is above the market curve to an increasing degree beyond the
end of next year.(a) Four-quarter inflation rate.
