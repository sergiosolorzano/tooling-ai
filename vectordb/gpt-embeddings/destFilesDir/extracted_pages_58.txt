Food price inflation, which has a large impact on the living costs of lower-income families
because it makes up a larger share of these families’ budgets, remains high. The annual
rate peaked at 19.1% in March and has since fallen back a little faster than expected in
the August Report, to 12.1% in September. Input prices continue to ease, but will take
time to transmit through the supply chain. Food price inflation is expected to fall to around
9% in 2023 Q4 and to around 5% in 2024 Q1, which remains broadly in line with the
intelligence gathered from contacts in the food sector reported in Box D of the August
Report.
Goods price inflation has moderated more quickly than expected in the August Report.
Some of the recent fall in goods price inflation has reflected developments in used car
prices, which tend to be driven by idiosyncratic factors. But there was also broader
downside news across a number of goods categories, with core goods inflation falling to
4.7% in September. Core goods price inflation is projected to fall further to 2.4% by March
2024, contributing to the expected reduction in headline inflation (Chart 2.16).
Easing input cost pressures are expected to continue to reduce consumer goods price
inflation in the coming months. Changes in producer price inflation tend to lead changes in
consumer goods price inflation by a few months. Output producer price inflation, which
measures the change in the price of goods sold by UK manufacturers, has slowed
significantly since its peak in mid-2022 (Chart 2.17).CPI inflation is expected to fall further to 4.4% in 2024 Q1. That mainly reflects
lower goods price inflation, as firms are expected to pass on lower producer price
inflation…
