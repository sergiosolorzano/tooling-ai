Government’s temporary additional tax relief on business investment. And the strong
growth in Q2 reflected transport investment which tends to be volatile. Indeed, the ONS
(2023)  report that acquisition of new aircraft was a large contributor to the quarterly figure.
In the latest DMP, businesses in 2023 Q2 expected nominal capital expenditure to grow
by an average rate of 2.7% over the coming year, down from a 6.1% expected increase in
2023 Q1. A wide range of factors influences businesses’ investment decisions; see Box D
for evidence on these from the Bank’s Agents. Real business investment is projected to
fall by just over 1% in 2024 and to be broadly flat in 2025, before increasing by 2% in
2026 (Section 1).
The exchange rate channel
Increases in UK interest rates relative to other countries’ rates would, all else equal, cause
the pound to appreciate. An exchange rate appreciation makes imports cheaper and
exports more expensive. Cheaper imports reduce UK inflation directly , because UK
households consume imported products, and indirectly, as imported goods and services
are used by firms in supply chains. There are also effects on UK activity through falling net
trade as UK exports become less competitive globally.
The exchange rate channel of monetary policy is particularly important for the UK
compared to other advanced economies because a high share of UK economic activity
involves trade with countries using different currencies.
Given most advanced economies have been raising rates at the same time as the UK, the
value of the pound has not appreciated since rate rises began. That suggests that, other
things equal, the impact on demand growth from monetary policy induced changes in the
exchange rate has been relatively limited to date. That said, had Bank Rate been kept at
the post-pandemic low, sterling might well have depreciated materially, leading to
additional inflation. Moreover, rate rises abroad have reduced demand in those countries
with a consequent reduction in demand for UK exports to those countries.Increasing interest rates across countries have limited the impact of the exchange
rate channel on UK demand growth.
