The Government provided significant fiscal support to households through the pandemic
and also in response to the energy price shock. Chart 3.3 shows two ways of quantifying
the level of fiscal support for the economy: the cyclically adjusted primary deficit and the
cumulative borrowing impact of government policies announced since Budget 2020. Both
these measures show record levels of fiscal policy support, particularly at the height of the
pandemic. Some of the more recent key policies have taken the form of transfers to
households, including the £400 Energy Bills Support Scheme and the Cost of Living
Payments for lower-income households. These will have directly supported household
demand.
Given the waning impacts of the pandemic and lower energy prices, fiscal support is
being progressively withdrawn. As shown in Chart 3.3, the level of support from fiscal
policy is expected to fall slightly in 2023–24 before falling more materially in subsequent
years.Chart 3.3: Support from fiscal policy is expected to fall in the coming years
Measures of fiscal support (a)
Sources: OBR and Bank calculations.
(a) Forecast as of March 2023. The cyclically adjusted primary deficit measures government expenditure excluding
interest costs net of government revenue, adjusted for the economic cycle by the OBR. It is presented as a share of
GDP consistent with the latest available ONS GDP data to the OBR at the time of its publication (Quarterly National
Accounts published 30 June 2023). Cumulative policy measures since March 2020 is the total of the OBR estimate of
the impact of government policies announced at successive fiscal events on public sector net borrowing, measured in
nominal terms. The final data points refer to the 2027–28 financial year.
