In projections conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates at
5.25% over the forecast period, the unemployment rate rises to a greater extent across
the forecast period compared with the MPC’s projection conditioned on market rates, as
the constant rate assumption is above the market curve to an increasing degree beyond
the end of next year.
Reflecting the considerable uncertainties around interpreting estimates from the Labour
Force Survey, there are risks in both directions around the recent path of the
unemployment rate, and hence the outlook for unemployment and labour market
tightness. The labour market could remain tighter than assumed for a number of economicChart 1.2: Unemployment rate projection based on market interest rate
expectations, other policy measures as announced
The fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for the ILO definition of unemployment. It has been
conditioned on Bank Rate following a path implied by market yields, but allows the Committee’ s judgement on the risks
around the other conditioning assumptions set out in Section 1.1, including wholesale energy prices, to af fect the
calibration of the fan chart skew. The coloured bands have the same interpretation as in Chart 1.1, and portray 90% of
the probability distribution. Up to June 2023, this fan chart is based on LFS unemployment data. Beyond this point, the
Committee is drawing on the collective steer from other indicators of unemployment to inform its projection (see Box B).
The fan begins in 2023 Q3, a quarter earlier than for CPI inflation. A significant proportion of this distribution lies below
Bank staff’s current estimate of the long-term equilibrium unemployment rate. There is therefore uncertainty about the
precise calibration of this fan chart.
The risks around the unemployment rate projection are judged to be broadly
balanced.
