wage growth is nonetheless projected to decline in coming quarters from these elevated
levels.
Twelve-month CPI inflation fell to 6.7% both in September and 2023 Q3, below
expectations in the August Report. This downside news largely reflects lower-than-
expected core goods price inflation. At close to 7%, services inflation has been only
slightly weaker than expected in August. CPI inflation remains well above the 2% target,
but is expected to continue to fall sharply, to 4¾% in 2023 Q4, 4½% in 2024 Q1 and 3¾%
in 2024 Q2. This decline is expected to be accounted for by lower energy, core goods and
food price inflation and, beyond January, by some fall in services inflation.
In the MPC’s latest most likely, or modal, projection conditioned on the market-implied
path for Bank Rate, CPI inflation returns to the 2% target by the end of 2025. It then falls
below the target thereafter, as an increasing degree of economic slack reduces domestic
inflationary pressures.
The Committee continues to judge that the risks to its modal inflation projection are
skewed to the upside. Second-round effects in domestic prices and wages are expected
to take longer to unwind than they did to emerge. There are also upside risks to inflation
from energy prices given events in the Middle East. Taking account of this skew, the mean
projection for CPI inflation is 2.2% and 1.9% at the two and three-year horizons
respectively. Conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates at
5.25%, which is a higher profile than the market curve beyond the second half of 2024,
mean CPI inflation returns to target in two years’ time and falls to 1.6% at the three-year
horizon.
The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy
of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that
there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and
disturbances. Monetary policy will ensure that CPI inflation returns to the 2% target
sustainably in the medium term.
Since the MPC’s previous decision, there has been little news in key indicators of UK
inflation persistence. There have continued to be signs of some impact of tighter monetary
policy on the labour market and on momentum in the real economy more generally . Given
the significant increase in Bank Rate since the start of this tightening cycle, the current
monetary policy stance is restrictive. At this meeting, the Committee voted to maintain
Bank Rate at 5.25%.
