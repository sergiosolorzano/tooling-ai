1.2: Key judgements and risks
1.2: Key judgement 1
GDP is expected to be broadly flat in the first half of the forecast period and growth
is projected to remain well below historical averages in the medium term. That
reflects the significant increase in Bank Rate since the start of this tightening cycle,
subdued potential supply growth, and a waning boost from fiscal policy .Sources: Bank of England, Bloomberg Finance L.P., Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), ONS, Refinitiv Eikon from
LSEG and Bank calculations.
(a) The table shows the projections for financial market prices, wholesale energy prices and government spending
projections that are used as conditioning assumptions for the MPC’ s projections for CPI inflation, GDP growth and the
unemployment rate. Figures in parentheses show the corresponding projections in the August 2023 Monetary Policy
Report.
(b) Financial market data are based on averages in the 15 working days to 24 October 2023. Figures show the average
level in Q4 of each year, unless otherwise stated.
(c) Per cent. The path for Bank Rate implied by forward market interest rates. The curves are based on overnight index
swap rates.
(d) Index. January 2005 = 100. The convention is that the sterling exchange rate follows a path that is half way between
the starting level of the sterling ERI and a path implied by interest rate dif ferentials.
(e) Dollars per barrel. Projection based on monthly Brent futures prices.
(f) Pence per therm. Projection based on monthly natural gas futures prices.
(g) Annual average growth rate. Nominal general government consumption and investment. Projections are based on
the OBR's March 2023 Economic and Fiscal Outlook. Historical data based on NMRP+D7QK.
