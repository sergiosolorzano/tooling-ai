There remain considerable uncertainties around the pace at which CPI inflation will return
sustainably to the 2% target.
There are near-term risks in both directions around the paths of CPI inflation and pay
growth. On the downside, weakness in non-labour input cost growth, including recent
developments in producer price indices, could lead to a faster-than-expected decline in
consumer goods price inflation. On the upside, the recent rise in private sector regular
AWE growth could prove to be a better guide to near-term wage growth dynamics than
the steer from other indicators of pay.
In the medium term, there remain considerable risks around the Committee’ s judgement
that second-round effects in domestic prices and wages are expected to take longer to
unwind than they did to emerge. On the one hand, these risks may be more balanced
following the MPC’s decision this round to increase further its assumption for the medium-
term equilibrium rate of unemployment, owing both to resistance to past losses in real
income and to more persistent labour market frictions (Key judgement 2), and the decisionChart 1.5: CPI inflation projection based on constant interest rates at 5.25%, other
policy measures as announced
This fan chart depicts the probability of various outcomes for CPI inflation in the future, conditioned on the assumptions
in Table 1.A footnote (b), apart from for Bank Rate, with this chart conditioned on constant interest rates at 5.25%. The
fan chart has the same interpretation as Chart 1.4.
The risks around the modal CPI inflation projection are judged to remain skewed
to the upside.
