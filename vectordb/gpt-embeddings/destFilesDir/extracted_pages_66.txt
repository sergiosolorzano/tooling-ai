Response rates have deteriorated further since mid-2020. The continued
deterioration might be an extension of the pre-Covid downward trend, which could
reflect a shift in societal attitudes towards responding to household surveys. Similar
downward trends in household survey response rates have been observed across
many other advanced economies (see, for example, Leeuw et al (2018) ).
The decline in response rates increases the risk that the LFS estimates may be
statistically biased. If the fall in responses is concentrated in households that have
different labour market characteristics than the average respondent, the survey will
be less representative as a result. In addition, the decline in response rates has
contributed to a reduction in the achieved sample size of the LFS. This means the
survey is experiencing higher sampling variability than in the past, which can result
in more volatile estimates from quarter to quarter.
In an effort to address some of these challenges the ONS is developing atransformed Labour Force Survey (TLFS). The new estimates will be based on
improved methods for collecting data, aimed at increasing the response rate, and aChart A: LFS response rates and achieved sample sizes have declined
