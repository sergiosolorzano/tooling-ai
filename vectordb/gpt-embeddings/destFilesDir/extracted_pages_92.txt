In real terms, after taking account of inflation, house prices have fallen by much more than
the nominal change. Based on the official ONS measure, real house prices have fallen by
around 7% since they peaked in January 2022.
Lower house prices could affect household consumption in two main ways: through direct
wealth effects and through the availability of collateral for loans. Evidence suggests that,
on average, direct effects are not large (Barrell et al (2015) ). This is because, while
property-owning households cut consumption when they experience a fall in their housing
wealth, these effects on aggregate consumption are relatively small. Indeed, they may be
reduced somewhat by an opposite effect in which lower house prices represent an
effective boost in wealth for future potential buyers. To the extent to which there are small
direct effects from changes in wealth values, evidence suggests this relates to an increase
in precautionary saving. The latest NMG survey indicates that some households are
reporting planning to save more in the coming months in response to lower house prices,
although the numbers were small. Bank analysis suggests that the collateral channel, in
which falling house prices reduce households’ available assets for borrowing, is more
important.
Together, the impact of interest rates via broader housing market effects is estimated to
grow over time. The reduction in the level of consumption from these effects by 2023 Q3
is estimated to be just under ½%. However, as asset prices and households continue to
adjust, that impact is likely to increase. Bank staff project that the overall reduction in
consumption from these effects will grow to over 2% by the end of 2026. These estimates
are uncertain and evidence suggests that the relationship between house prices and
consumption can vary over time (Benito et al (2006)).
