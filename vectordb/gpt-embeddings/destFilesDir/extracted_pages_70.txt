Box C: How has Blue Book 2023 changed past estimates of
UK GDP growth ?
Each year the ONS updates its estimates of GDP growth in past years to reflect
improvements in its methodologies and additional data. The Blue Book 2023
revisions included large changes to estimates of GDP growth over 2020 and 2021,
a time when measuring the size of the economy was particularly challenging (ONS
(2023) ). Annual GDP growth is now estimated to have been 0.7 percentage points
higher in 2020 and 1.1 percentage points higher in 2021. Growth rates since then
are little changed.
Following the revisions, UK GDP is now estimated to have exceeded its pre-
pandemic level by 2021 Q4, rather than having remained slightly below it (Chart A).
In 2023 Q2, GDP is estimated to have been 1.8% above its pre-Covid level. On
current estimates, the UKâ€™s post-Covid recovery in output is now more in line with
other G7 countries.The ONS raised its estimates of GDP growth over 2020 and 2021 in its
annual Blue Book revisions.
The latest estimates imply that UK output returned to its pre-Covid level by
the end of 2021.
