Manufactured goods exports volumes growth has slowed, with exports now at the
same level as a year ago. Consumer goods exports volumes fell, with EU sales
notably weaker. This reflected softer demand but also Brexit-related trade frictions.
While demand from the US and Middle East remained robust, it has softened from
China. Services exports values growth has slowed but remained positive, mostly
driven by fee increases. There are near-term downside risks from weaker consumer
demand and the continued impact of Brexit-related trade frictions, although contacts
expected demand for aerospace, defence, and pharmaceuticals to remain robust.Chart A: Structural factors are motivating higher investment spending next
year
Factors affecting investment over the next 12 months (a)
Source: Bank calculations.
(a) Taken from responses to the Agents’ survey on investment intentions. Question: ‘How are the following
factors affecting your UK investment spending plans over the next 12 months compared to the past 12
months?’. Reports of ‘slight’ reduction/boost were given a 50% weight relative to reports of ‘substantial’
reduction/boost when calculating these net balances.
Goods export volume and services export value growth have slowed over
the past year. Contacts cited the ongoing impact of Brexit-related trade
frictions.
Revenue growth in business services, while slightly weaker, continues to be
sustained by inflation as volumes fell slightly on a year ago. Manufacturing
volumes have reduced a little, and construction output continues to decline.
