Despite the headwinds to income growth, households are relatively optimistic about their
future finances. In the Bank’s NMG survey, the measure of households’ expectations for
their own financial situation over the next year has improved substantially since 2022 and
is now in line with results prior to the pandemic. Survey responses also suggest that
households’ perceived risk of job loss has been falling and is now at its lowest level since
2015, although expectations for the level of economy-wide unemployment have increased
slightly over the past six months. The NMG’s measure of household income expectations
has also risen, although this largely reflects the expectation that nominal incomes will
grow given high inflation.
During the pandemic, household consumption fell by more than income as households
were less able to spend on services, which meant that in aggregate households built up
additional savings. Much of these additional savings took the form of bank deposits. As
shown on the left of Chart 3.4, the total stock of household deposits rose materially ,
peaking around 10% higher than its previous trend in 2022 Q1. A similar pattern has been
observed across advanced economies (IMF (2023) ).…although households in the NMG survey remain optimistic about their future
finances.
Household saving decisions will also affect the demand outlook; there is some
evidence to suggest that households have been saving less recently .
