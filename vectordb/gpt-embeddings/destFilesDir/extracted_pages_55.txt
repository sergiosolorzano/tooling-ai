Measures of staff salaries for new hires within the KPMG/REC Report, which have in the
past been a strong predictor of aggregate private sector pay growth, returned to levels
close to their historical averages this year and continued to fall in September (Chart 2.15).
This might indicate that aggregate pay growth is likely to return to levels consistent with
the inflation target next year. However, the predictive power of these data has been less
strong over recent months. Labour hoarding following a period of acute recruitment
difficulties could explain the strength of pay growth for current employees relative to new
hires. Changes in how frequently people move jobs might also affect the relationship
between the salaries of new hires in the REC survey and the official wage data, although
staff analysis suggests that the impact of this on the current outlook is small.Chart 2.15: Forward-looking indicators suggest pay growth could slow markedly in
2024
Measures of annual wage growth (a)
Sources: DMP Survey, KPMG/REC/S&P Global UK Report on Jobs, ONS and Bank calculations.
(a) Definitions of wage growth vary between each of the measures. Private sector regular pay growth is Bank staf f’s
estimate of underlying pay growth between January 2020 and November 2022 and ONS private sector regular pay
growth otherwise. REC shows average starting salaries for permanent staf f compared to the previous month. The REC
index is mean-variance adjusted to ONS private sector regular pay growth over March 2001–19 and is advanced by 12
months, which coincides with the greatest correlation with private sector regular pay growth. The Agents’ contacts
expected range is based on early indications on pay settlements in 2024. Latest data points are September 2023 for the
REC index, and the three months to August 2023 for private sector regular pay. Pay growth projections are for 2023 Q4
and 2024 Q1.
