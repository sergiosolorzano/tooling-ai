A measure of medium-term inflation compensation in financial markets has risen over the
course of the year and stands well above its average level over the previous decade,
though still below its peak in the first half of 2022 (Chart 2.21). Interpreting these data is
challenging because they can move for reasons unrelated to inflation expectations, for
example due to illiquidity in markets and the use of these instruments in hedging pension
liabilities. As this is a measure of RPI inflation compensation, any changes in the outlook
for the wedge between RPI and CPI can also affect these data.
The median respondent in the November Market Participants Survey expected CPI
inflation of 2.1% three years ahead, down slightly from 2.2% in August. The distribution of
survey responses remained skewed to the upside.Chart 2.20: Firms’ CPI inflation expectations have fallen back
