Starting in February 2024, services inflation is expected to fall back gradually . Labour
costs make up the bulk of services firms’ production costs, so price pressures for services
are likely to decline as wage growth is expected to moderate. Non-labour input costs have
also played a role in pushing up services inflation over the past two years. In recent
months, the S&P Global/CIPS UK services input and output price PMIs have continued to
fall, signalling that the non-labour elements of services firms’  costs are already
moderating. Consistent with these data, the Bank’s Agents’ contacts report that, although
pay pressures are still significant for consumer-facing services companies, other cost
pressures are mostly easing.
Overall, services CPI inflation is projected to fall back to 6.4% by March 2024 (Chart
2.18), consistent with the expected decline in pay pressures and broader input price
inflation.Chart 2.18: A measure of underlying services inflation has started to fall back

(a) The methodology for an aggregate underlying inflation measure is set out in Potjagailo et al (2022). The underlying
services inflation measure shown here focuses on comovement in the prices of services items rather than all items. The
inflation rate of each item is disentangled into a common component and idiosyncratic fluctuations using a dynamic
factor model. In a second step, the common components of individual services price items are aggregated into the
underlying services inflation measure using the CPI item weights. The latest data are for September 2023, the projection
is to March 2024.
