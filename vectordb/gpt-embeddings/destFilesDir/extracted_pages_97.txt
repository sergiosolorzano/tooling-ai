Rising interest rates are likely to contribute to a reduction in business investment growth.
Evidence from the Decision Maker Panel (DMP) from January 2023 suggested that
interest rates were expected to reduce business investment by 8% on average over the
following year. This effect was driven by only a third of businesses, as many businesses
do not have debt and may not be affected by interest rate changes directly, or do not
make investments. Despite this, some firms without debt expected to cut their investment
as a result of higher interest rates. This suggests some of the estimated impact on
investment is potentially capturing second-round effects of reduced demand in the
economy limiting the need for additional investment.
Headline business investment growth in 2023 H1 has been strong: rising 4.1% over 2023
Q2 alone and 9.2% compared to 2022 Q2. However, this may not provide a clear steer on
the effect of interest rates due to erratic factors affecting the data. The ONS (2023)  report
that strong investment growth in 2023 Q1 was likely affected by the end of theChart 3.11: Concerns around interest rates are rising but remain below other

business?’ for the following month. Some months’ data have two results, where the survey has asked for that month in
more than one wave. Where that is the case, the results have been averaged. Results are weighted to match the count
of all businesses with 10 or more employees. The final data points refer to October 2023.
…and that concern is reflected in expected business investment growth.
