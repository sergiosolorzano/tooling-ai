While global energy prices remain significantly below the levels seen in 2022, they have
increased since the August Report. Spot oil prices reached around £75 per barrel in
September, and November 2023 futures prices have risen by about 20% since the August
Report (Chart 2.4).
Given the subdued outlook for global activity, demand factors are unlikely to have put
much upward pressure on oil prices. But oil supply has been reduced by cuts in
production by OPEC and Russia, amounting to two million barrels per day over 2023.
Wholesale gas spot prices have also risen, but remain significantly lower and less volatile
than in 2022. Wholesale gas futures prices are little changed since August (Chart 2.4).
European gas storage levels are high compared with recent years, reducing the likelihood
of shortages over the winter.
The risk of energy prices rising further has increased following recent events in the Middle
East (Section 1).…although global energy prices have risen since August, and the risk of them
rising further has increased.
