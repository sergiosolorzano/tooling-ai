However, recent data releases suggest that the gradual improvement in the near-term
outlook for GDP has stalled (Section 2.2). In assessing the likely evolution of the
economy, a key question for the MPC is the extent to which supportive factors will remain

will slow demand growth. Given the significant increase in Bank Rate since the start of
this tightening cycle, the current monetary policy stance is restrictive.

(a) The independent forecasters series shows the mean of HMT’s survey of independent forecasters. This includes the
most recent forecast for each institution included in the survey and therefore can include forecasts made in earlier
months than each survey period. Differences between independent forecasters and the Bank’s projections will in part
relate to different conditioning assumptions for their forecasts. The evolution of the Bank’s MPR forecasts reflects a
sequence of judgements made by the MPC about the likely outlook for demand (see Key judgement 1 in Section 1). The
final data points refer to the October 2023 average forecast from HMT’ s survey of independent forecasters and
projections from this Report respectively.
