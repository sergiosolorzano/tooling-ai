The ONS’s estimate of the proportion of working-age people in the labour force is also
affected by the uncertainties surrounding the LFS estimates, with the participation rate
probably overestimated (Box B). These issues notwithstanding, the rise in participation
since mid-2022 has been partly driven by a return of students to the labour force. Those
reporting they are outside the labour force due to looking after family or the home and
retirement has also declined. The number of people saying they are unable to participate
in the workforce due to sickness remains elevated, however, and is just over half a million
higher than before the pandemic.
A range of evidence points to the labour market having loosened, consistent with a
restrictive stance of monetary policy. The ONS vacancies to unemployment ratio, a key
measure of labour market tightness, has been falling since August 2022. This reflects both
a steady fall in the number of vacancies and rising unemployment (right panel of ChartChart 2.11: An indicator-based model points to flat employment in 2023 Q4

(a) LFS employment growth is the change in headline employment level for people aged 16+ over the value in the
previous quarter. Latest data point is for 2023 Q2.
(b) Bank staff’s indicator-based model of near-term employment growth uses mixed-data sampling (or MIDAS)
techniques (see Daniell and Moreira (2023)  for more detail). A range of indicators inform the model, including series
from the Bank of England Agents, the Lloyds Business Barometer, ONS/HMRC PAYE payrolls, S&P Global/CIPS
purchasing managers’ index and the KPMG/REC UK Report on Jobs. Indicators are weighted together according to
their relative forecast performance in the recent past. Diamonds represent projections for 2023 Q3 and Q4.
