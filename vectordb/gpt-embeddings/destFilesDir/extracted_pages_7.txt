1: The economic outlook
Twelve-month CPI inflation remains well above the MPC’s 2% target, but has fallen
back to 6.7% both in September and in 2023 Q3 as a whole, below expectations in
the August Monetary Policy Report. Most of the downside news since the previous
Report reflects lower core goods price inflation. Services inflation has been only
slightly weaker than expected in August and remains elevated. CPI inflation is
expected to continue to fall quite sharply in the near term, to an average of around
4¾% in 2023 Q4, 4½% in 2024 Q1 and 3¾% in 2024 Q2. Most indicators of pay
growth have tended to be stable at rates of growth that are high. But they have not
shown the recent rise in the annual rate of growth of the private sector regular AWE
series. Earnings growth is expected to be somewhat stronger than in the August
Report, but is still projected to decline in coming quarters from these elevated
levels.
Second-round effects in domestic prices and wages are expected to take longer to
unwind than they did to emerge (Key judgement 3). In the most likely , or modal,
forecast conditioned on the market-implied path of interest rates, an increasing
degree of slack in the economy and declining external cost pressures lead CPI
inflation to return to the 2% target by the end of 2025 and to fall below target
thereafter. Compared with the August Report modal projection, inflation is expected
to return to close to the 2% target slightly less rapidly in the middle of the forecast
period, reflecting higher energy and other import price inflation.
The Committee continues to judge that the risks to its modal projection are skewed
to the upside. Taking account of this skew, and conditioned on market interest rates,
mean CPI inflation is 2.2% and 1.9% at the two and three-year horizons
respectively. In the mean projection conditioned on the alternative assumption of
constant interest rates at 5.25% over the forecast period, CPI inflation is expected
to be 2.0% and 1.6% in two years’ and three years’ time respectively.
Given the significant increase in Bank Rate since the start of this tightening cycle,
the current monetary policy stance is restrictive. GDP is expected to be broadly flat
in the first half of the forecast period and growth is projected to remain well below
historical averages in the medium term, also reflecting a waning boost from fiscal
policy and subdued potential supply growth (Key judgement 1). GDP  is lower
