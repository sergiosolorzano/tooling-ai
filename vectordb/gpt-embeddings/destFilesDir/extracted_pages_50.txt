2.12). The ONS’s alternative experimental statistics, which take the LFS unemployment
estimate in the three months to June and project it forward in line with the claimant count
data thereafter, suggest that the unemployment rate may have increased to 4.2% in the
three months to August. This would be higher than expected in the August Report. The
unemployment rate is projected to rise a little further in 2023 Q4.
While there are significant uncertainties around the LFS data at present (Box B), other
indicators are also indicative of a loosening in the labour market. Recent KPMG/REC
Report on Jobs surveys have pointed to some easing of recruitment dif ficulties and a pick-
up in staff availability. This is consistent with evidence from the ONS’s Business Insights
and Conditions Survey, in which the number of firms reporting difficulties recruiting has
trended down in recent months. The latest recruitment difficulties score from the Bank’s
Agents has also fallen back from its peak in mid-2022, though it remains above its
historical average. Despite the reported easing in hiring constraints, Agents’ contacts
reported that persistent skills shortages remain in some sectors.
Despite evidence that the labour market is loosening, it remains tight in a historical
context. The vacancies to unemployment ratio is still elevated, and above its 2019 Q4
level (left panel of Chart 2.12). And it is noteworthy that the period immediately before the
pandemic was one where there was considered to be little spare capacity in the labour
market (see November 2019 Report ).
Another measure of labour market tightness is the gap between the current
unemployment rate and the equilibrium rate of unemployment. The equilibrium rate of
unemployment – which is not observable and has to be estimated – is defined as the rate
consistent with meeting the inflation target in the medium term (see Box 4 of the February
2018 Report ). If the unemployment rate is below this equilibrium rate that tends to put
upwards pressure on wage growth and inflation, as companies need to pay more to
recruit suitably skilled staff.
The long-term equilibrium unemployment rate changes only slowly over time, determined
by structural features of the economy that affect the time it takes for people to find the
right jobs. The MPC’s latest estimate suggests that the long-term equilibrium
unemployment rate is just above 4% (see Section 3 of the February 2023 Report ). The
Committee will revisit this estimate as part of its forthcoming supply stocktake.
The medium-term equilibrium unemployment rate is more relevant for determining the
degree of slack in the labour market and hence wage pressures, however . It can be
affected by cyclical factors, such as changes in the mix of jobs and job seekers. Wage…but it remains tight by historical standards.
