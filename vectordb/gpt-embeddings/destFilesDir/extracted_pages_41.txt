Partly reflecting stronger demand in the US leading the dollar to appreciate, and a smaller
differential between expected policy rates in the UK and the US and euro area, the
sterling effective exchange rate has depreciated by about 2.3% since the August Report.
Sterling has fallen by 5.5% against the dollar, and by 1% against the euro.
Yields on 10-year government bonds have risen since August across advanced
economies. This partly reflects market expectations that policy rates will remain higher for
longer. But models used by Bank staff to analyse movements in long-term bond yields
suggest it also reflects a rise in term premia – the compensation that investors require for
the risks associated with holding government bonds of longer duration.
Fixed-rate mortgages make up around 80% of the stock of UK mortgages, and the rates
on new fixed-rate mortgages are influenced by expectations of Bank Rate (Box C of theFebruary 2022 Report ). Since August, quoted fixed-rate mortgage rates have fallen,
largely reflecting pass-through of lower reference rates, but they remain substantially
higher than at the start of the Bank Rate tightening cycle (Chart 2.6). Analysis by Bank
staff has found that the pass-through from reference rates to mortgage rates has occurred
largely as expected during this period as a whole (Box B of the May 2023 Report ).
Interest rates on new fixed-rate savings bonds, which, like new fixed-rate mortgage rates,
are influenced by expectations of Bank Rate, have ticked down slightly in the most recent
data. Instant access savings accounts tend to be priced relative to current Bank Rate, and
pass-through from previous increases in Bank Rate has been slow. However, the recent
data suggest this has accelerated, with average quoted rates increasing by around 90
basis points between June and October, although the spread between instant access
deposit rates and Bank Rate remains wide (Chart 2.6). Some of this acceleration may be
driven by banks and building societies responding to the FCA’s action plan on cash
savings , which aims to ensure firms appropriately reflect changes in Bank Rate in the
rates they offer to depositors.…and UK fixed-rate mortgage rates have declined.
