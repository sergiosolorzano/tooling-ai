This distributional pattern is important because household behaviour is likely to vary
across the distribution, which can shape the aggregate demand outlook. For example,
households at the top of the savings distribution are likely to be less responsive to
changes in broader economic trends, such as the weakening in the labour market. And
higher wealth and income households also make up a disproportionate share of
consumption: in 2021–22, the tenth of households with the highest income made up
around a fifth of household expenditure.
There are uncertainties around whether households can support consumption by running
down savings or saving less out of their current income in the future. The right panel in
Chart 3.4 shows that when savings are considered relative to income, the above-trend
savings built up during the pandemic have been fully eroded. If households aim to
maintain a stock of savings in line with incomes, they may not want to draw down savings
any further. In terms of saving out of current income, the aggregate saving rate is
projected to remain fairly flat over the MPC’s forecast period, as unemployment increases.Chart 3.6: The aggregate saving rate is expected to be broadly unchanged over the
next three years

(a) The cash-based savings ratio excludes transactions which are imputed and unobserved by households, for example
the imputed value gained by owner-occupiers from living in their home. The final outturn data is for 2023 Q2 and the
final forecast value is for 2026 Q4.
