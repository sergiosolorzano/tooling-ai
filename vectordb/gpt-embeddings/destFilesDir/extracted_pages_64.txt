Chart 2.21: A measure of medium-term inflation expectations in financial markets
has been drifting up since the start of the year
RPI-reform adjusted measure of five-year, five-year forward inflation compensation (a)
Sources: Bloomberg Finance L.P. and Bank calculations.
(a) Market-derived inflation compensation rates for average UK RPI inflation over a five-year period starting five years
into the future. It is derived by adjusting the five-year, five-year rate to account for UK RPI reform. From 2030, UK RPI
will be aligned with the CPIH measure of consumer prices. At present, the wedge between the current definition of RPI
and CPIH affects the unadjusted series. This measure is calculated by adding a scaled market-derived estimate of the
impact of RPI reform onto the unadjusted rate. That is calculated as the difference between the closest one-year forward
rates before and after the planned RPI reform date (currently the five-year , one-year rate and the seven-year, one-year
rate) on a three-month daily rolling average basis, and the adjustment is applied to the five-year forward period
impacted by the reform. The latest data point is 24 October 2023.
