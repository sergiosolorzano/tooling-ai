to increase slightly its judgement on the persistence of domestic prices. On the other
hand, it is possible that the higher path of pay growth puts even greater upward pressure
on domestic price inflation over the forecast period. There could remain an inconsistency
between the wage and domestic price profiles in the modal projections, such that
companies seek to rebuild their squeezed profit margins to a greater extent than has been
assumed. Nevertheless, the Bank’s Agents report that firms generally have limited scope
to rebuild margins significantly by raising their prices.
The pace at which CPI inflation falls back to the 2% target will also depend on inflation
expectations. An upside risk to the inflation outlook is that households and firms are less
confident that inflation will fall back quickly and do not factor such a decline into their
wage and price-setting behaviour. Since the August Report, indicators of household and
corporate short-term inflation expectations have tended to decline further , while medium-
term inflation compensation measures in financial markets have remained above their
long-term averages. The Committee will continue to monitor measures of inflation
expectations very closely and act to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations are
anchored at the 2% target.
There are upside risks around the modal projection for UK CPI inflation from international
factors. There remains the possibility of more persistence in consumer price inflation in
the UK’s major trading partners, for similar reasons to the risks of stronger domestic
inflationary pressures at home including the tightness of labour markets, and wage and
services price inflation remaining elevated for longer than expected.
In addition, geopolitical risks have increased following events in the Middle East. Although
there has so far been only a relatively limited rise in energy prices, uncertainty around
future oil prices has increased and the balance of risks around future oil prices has shifted
from the downside to the upside, as indicated by implied volatilities and risk reversals in
financial markets. A larger shock to energy prices could mean that CPI inflation falls back
to the 2% target more slowly than currently expected, through both direct and second-
round effects, while also leading to weaker growth (Key judgement 1).
Overall, the Committee judge that the risks around the modal projection for CPI inflation
remain skewed to the upside, primarily reflecting the possibility of more persistence in
domestic wage and price-setting, but also the increasing upside risk to inflation from
energy prices now. This pushes up on the mean, relative to the modal, inflation projections
in the forecast. Conditioned on market interest rates, mean CPI inflation is 2.2% and 1.9%
at the two and three-year horizons respectively.
