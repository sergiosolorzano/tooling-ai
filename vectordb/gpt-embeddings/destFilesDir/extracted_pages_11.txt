UK GDP is expected to have been flat in 2023 Q3, weaker than expected in the August
Monetary Policy Report (Section 2.2). Indicators of growth in Q4 are mixed. Some
business surveys are pointing to a slight contraction in GDP, but others are less
pessimistic. Many contacts of the Bankâ€™s Agents have continued to report weak activity
growth and a subdued outlook. On balance, Bank staff expect GDP to grow by 0.1% in the
fourth quarter, also weaker than projected in August.
Household consumption growth is now expected to be similarly weak during the second
half of this year, consistent with recent declines in retail sales volumes, consumer services
output and consumer confidence. Nonetheless, real labour income growth has been
slightly stronger than expected and workers do not appear to have become more
pessimistic about the security of their own jobs.
For a number of forecast rounds, the Committee has made a judgement to boost the
expected path of demand in light of the surprising resilience of economic activity . This
reflected a number of factors, including the possibility of lower precautionary saving by
households, in turn related to a lower risk of job loss given continued strength in labour
market activity. Developments since August, including in the labour market (Key
judgement 2), suggest that economic activity has been somewhat less resilient over
recent months. As a result, in its latest growth projection, the Committee has scaled back
somewhat the extent of this judgement to boost demand, but has not taken it out
completely.
Given the significant increase in Bank Rate since the start of this tightening cycle, the
current monetary policy stance is restrictive. There are increasing signs of some impact of
tighter policy on momentum in the real economy (Section 3.3). Based on the average
relationships over the past between Bank Rate, other financial instruments and economic
activity, Bank staff estimate that more than half of the impact of higher interest rates on
the level of GDP is still to come through, although there is significant uncertainty around
that estimate. The Committee will continue to monitor closely the impact of the significant
increase in Bank Rate. It will also continue to keep under review the relationship between
Bank Rate and economic activity, including how it may have changed during the current
tightening cycle.
Taken together, the pass-through of past rises in interest rates and the latest market-
implied interest rate path on which the forecast is conditioned (Section 1.1) continue to
push down on GDP over the forecast period. Nevertheless, the fall in the market path over
recent months pushes up on GDP in this forecast compared with the August projection, all
else equal.
