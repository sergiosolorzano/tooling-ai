compared with August, reflecting recent weaker-than-expected activity data and the
Committee’s related decision in this forecast to reduce somewhat the scale of, but
not to remove completely, its previous judgement boosting expected demand.
The margin of excess demand in the UK economy has diminished over recent
quarters and an increasing degree of economic slack is expected to emerge from
the start of next year (Key judgement 2). Unemployment is expected to rise further
over the forecast period and exceed the Committee’s upwardly revised estimate of
the medium-term equilibrium rate from the end of next year. There are increased
uncertainties around the ONS’s official labour market activity data that have
previously been based on the Labour Force Survey, and the Committee is therefore
continuing to consider the collective steer from a range of indicators.

(a) Figures in parentheses show the corresponding projections in the August 2023 Monetary Policy Report.
(b) Unless otherwise stated, the numbers shown in this table are modal projections and are conditioned on the
assumptions described in Section 1.1. The main assumptions are set out in Monetary Policy Report – Download
chart slides and data – November 2023 .
(c) Four-quarter growth in real GDP.
(d) Four-quarter inflation rate. The modal projection is the single most likely outcome. If the risks are symmetrically
distributed around this central view, this will also provide a view of the average outcome or mean forecast. But when the
risks are skewed, as in the current forecast, the mean projection will dif fer from the mode.
(e) ILO definition of unemployment. Up to June 2023, this projection is based on LFS unemployment data. Beyond this
point, the Committee is drawing on the collective steer from other indicators of unemployment to inform its projection
(see Box B).
(f) Per cent of potential GDP. A negative figure implies output is below potential and a positive that it is above.
(g) Per cent. The path for Bank Rate implied by forward market interest rates. The curves are based on overnight index
swap rates.
