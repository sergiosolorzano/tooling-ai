The ONS measure of the aggregate saving rate still remains higher than before the
pandemic, matched by a similar trend in the cash-based saving rate (Chart 3.6). The
difference between the NMG survey, which suggests households are saving less, and the
aggregate ONS data may reflect differences in behaviour across the savings and income
distribution. The distribution in household savings in the UK is highly skewed (see, for
example, Broome and Leslie (2022)). This means that behaviour at the top of the
distribution has a much larger impact on the aggregate saving rate.
Evidence from the NMG survey shows that, on average, the highest income households
have been much more likely to increase their savings levels compared to a year ago.
Within the highest income decile, the share of respondents who increased their savings
over the past year is 25 percentage points higher than those who have reduced their
savings. In contrast, for the bottom half of the income distribution, respondents on
average report having fewer savings than a year ago.Chart 3.5: Fewer households are expecting to save less than usual in the next six

(a) Results show responses to the survey question: ‘As a result of any changes in income or spending, would you say
that your household has saved more, less, or the same over the last six months compared with how much you usually
save?’. Respondents who indicated having a different saving pattern to normal were asked a follow-up question. If they
saved less than usual, they were asked if that would continue. And if they saved more than usual, they were asked if
that would continue. Respondents saving around their usual rate over the past six months are excluded from the chart.
The survey results were collected between 30 August and 19 September.
