2.1: Global developments and domestic credit conditions
Global growth has remained subdued over the course of 2023. UK-weighted world GDP  is
expected to have grown by around 0.4% in 2023 Q3, similar to Q2 and broadly in line with
the projection in the August Report. Four-quarter growth in 2023 Q3 is expected to be
around 1.5%, below its 2010–19 average of 2.4%. The latest indicators, such as cross-
country purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs), suggest that global GDP growth is likely to
remain weak in Q4.show October to December 2023 (August projections show July to September 2023). GDP  growth rate 2023 Q3
projections are based on official data to August, the CPI inflation figure is an outturn. For unemployment, up to 2023 Q2
the series is based on official LFS data. Beyond this point, the Committee is drawing on the collective steer from other
indicators of unemployment to inform its projection.
