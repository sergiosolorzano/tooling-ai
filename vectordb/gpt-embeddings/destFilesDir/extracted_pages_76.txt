Investors’ demand for commercial real estate has softened given their perception of
an increased likelihood of ‘higher-for-longer’ interest rates. There were isolated
reports of forced sales due to increased outflows from portfolio funds held by
institutional investors. Banks have started responding more firmly to breaches in
loan covenants, leading to an expectation of more forced sales next year .
Larger corporates typically reported continued access to bank or non-bank finance
through 2023. Contacts say banks have tightened lending supply for small
businesses, with some reports of banks rejecting new loans, not rolling over debt,
or imposing more onerous terms and conditions.
Demand for credit has remained weak across firms of all sizes due to higher
interest rates and uncertainty about the economic outlook. This was consistent with
declining bank loan books. Large corporates were issuing fewer bonds in the hope
that yields would decline, and private equity firms were much less active.
Bad debts were still at normal levels, although the failure rate of the smallest
companies was higher than recent years. Companies in the construction sector
were faring the worst, with trade credit tightening and even some large companies
getting into difficulty.
Many contacts were looking to maintain employment at current levels, if they judged
they were the right size to meet demand or if they were prepared to hoard labour
after experience of recruiting difficulties in the past. There was a slight uptick in
reports of planned headcount reductions in property and construction, although
such reports remain in the minority. Some sectors such as audit, insurance,
pharmaceuticals, and aerospace have continued to expand their workforces on the
back of growth.
Recruitment difficulties have continued to ease for many contacts, particularly for
lower-skilled roles. But recruitment remained a serious concern for contacts in
particular locations and for contacts demanding skills in the finance, accountancy ,
IT, and engineering sectors.Credit supply has tightened for small firms, less so for large corporates.
Demand for credit remains weak given high interest rates.
Employment intentions have softened a little further since mid-August but
overall remained consistent with broadly stable headcount in the coming
year. Recruitment difficulties have continued to ease, although skill
shortages were still a concern for some.
