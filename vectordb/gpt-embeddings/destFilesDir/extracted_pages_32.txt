Box A: Monetary policy since the August 2023 Report
At its meeting ending on 20 September 2023, the MPC voted by a majority of 5–4 to
maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%. Four members preferred to increase Bank Rate by
0.25 percentage points, to 5.5%. The Committee also voted unanimously to reduce
the stock of UK government bond purchases held for monetary policy purposes,
and financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by £100 billion over the next
12 months, to a total of £658 billion.
Since the MPC’s previous meeting, global growth had evolved broadly in line with
the August Report projections, albeit with some differences across regions. Spot oil
prices had risen significantly, while underlying inflationary pressures had remained
elevated across advanced economies.
UK GDP was estimated to have declined by 0.5% in July and the S&P Global/CIPS
composite output PMI fell in August, although other business survey indicators
remained consistent with positive GDP growth. While some of this news could
prove erratic, Bank staff expected GDP to rise only slightly in 2023 Q3. Underlying
growth in the second half of 2023 was also likely to be weaker than expected.
There had been some further signs of a loosening in the labour market, although it
remained tight by historical standards. The vacancies to unemployment ratio had
continued to decline, reflecting both a steady fall in the number of vacancies and
rising unemployment. The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate had risen to
4.3% in the three months to July, higher than expected in the August Report.
Indicators of employment had generally softened against the backdrop of subdued
activity.
Annual private sector regular average weekly earnings (AWE) growth had
increased to 8.1% in the three months to July, 0.8 percentage points above the
August Report projection. The recent path of the AWE was, however, difficult to
reconcile with other indicators of pay growth. Most of these had tended to be more
stable at rates of growth that were elevated but not quite as high as the AWE series.
Twelve-month CPI inflation fell from 7.9% in June to 6.7% in August, 0.4 percentage
points below expectations at the time of the Committee’s previous meeting. Core
goods CPI inflation had fallen from 6.4% in June to 5.2% in August, much weaker
than expected in the August Report. Services CPI inflation rose from 7.2% in June
